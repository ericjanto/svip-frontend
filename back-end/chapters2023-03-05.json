Хотя факт, что она солидарна с главой семейства Малфой, весьма тревожный, всё же услышать, как кто-то выражает их общее возмущение в такой взрывной манере, — своего рода облегчение. Самой Гермионе ещё только предстояло побороть безмолвное, неверящее отчаяние.", "Вспышка гнева придёт к ней позже, в этом она была уверена. Но к тому моменту заседание уже давно будет закрыто, и её жалобы останутся проигнорированными. Вероятно, Гермиона пожалеет, что не воспользовалась шансом высказаться, но тех нескольких мгновений, когда она смогла оторвать взгляд от пергамента в своих руках, было более чем достаточно, чтобы распознать отсутствующее выражение лица Кингсли. Он мастерски игнорировал закатанную взрослым мужчиной истерику. Ничто из сказанного кем-либо в этом кабинете не могло пошатнуть министра.", "Ноготь большого пальца снова зацепил надорванный угол листа, который Гермиона держала в руках, — надорванный около двух ночи, через несколько часов после того, как заказной совой было доставлено письмо. От нескончаемого волнения пальцы скользили по верхней части министерского бланка, почти подобравшись к печати. Такими темпами через несколько минут произошёл бы необратимый разрыв между «Министерством» и «магией».", "Иронично, учитывая, что слова на пергаменте гласили о создании уз, а не об их разрыве.", "Потребовалось несколько секунд, чтобы заметить внезапно воцарившуюся в кабинете тишину, Гермиона бросила взгляд в сторону как раз вовремя, чтобы увидеть, как Люциус рухнул в кресло рядом со своей женой. Нарцисса Малфой сидела прямо, как шомпол, глазами устремившись вперёд, будто была намерена воспринимать как можно меньше происходящего вокруг.", "Кингсли несколько секунд сидел неподвижно, на громадном письменном столе негромко тикали вычурные золотые часы. Казалось, министр ждал нового шквала жалоб, но когда их не последовало, заговорил:", "— Я ценю ваше беспокойство, Люциус, — начал он, поудобнее скрестив руки на животе, — но, как вы знаете, положения законодательства предельно ясны: вашему сыну поручено жениться на мисс Грейнджер, и он сделает это, если не хочет возвращаться в Азкабан.", "Упоминание тюрьмы, прозвучавшее глубоким баритоном Кинсгли, казалось, пронзило младшего Малфоя насквозь. Он вздрогнул в кресле — подал первый признак жизни с тех пор, как пять минут назад вошёл в кабинет.", "Гермиона понятия не имела, чего ожидать, когда получила второе письмо — на этот раз написанное от имени Малфоя, а не Министерства — с просьбой присутствовать на апелляции следующим утром. Она была слишком озабочена мыслью о принудительном браке с Драко Малфоем, чтобы думать ещё и о том, что он точно так же недоволен идеей жениться на ней. Гермиона была удивлена, что Малфои смогли добиться личной встречи с министром в такой короткий срок, но, учитывая степень недовольства Люциуса, возможно, выслушать его без промедления — это путь наименьшего сопротивления для Кингсли.", "— Это распределение — издевательство, — прошипел Люциус. — Нам сказали, что пары будут основаны на магической совместимости.", "— Так и есть, — ответил Кингсли.", "Драко фыркнул.", "От этого звука вспышка негодования прорвалась сквозь ледяное отчаяние в груди Гермионы. Из тех тысяч людей, с которыми она могла совпасть, это должен был оказаться именно тот, кто считал её неполноценной. Её искушало желание сказать «спасибо» этому браку просто назло Малфою.", "Хотя Гермиона ничего не слышала о нём с момента его освобождения из Азкабана, как только она увидела Малфоя тем утром, поняла, что ничего в нём не изменилось. Несмотря на то, что они собрались вместе для обсуждения решения, которое полностью изменит ход их жизней, взгляд Малфоя скользнул по креслу, занятому Гермионой, так, будто оно было пустым. Единственными признаками того, что он осознавал её присутствие в кабинете, были его горделивая осанка и лёгкая презрительная усмешка на губах. И хотя сейчас они сидели достаточно близко, чтобы их руки почти соприкасались, всё, что Гермиона могла почувствовать вместо тепла живого человеческого тела, — это пелена надменного безразличия.", "— Кингсли, — начала она хриплым от долгого молчания голосом, — у совместимостей ведь широкий диапазон. Должны быть и другие подходящие пары.", "— Подходящие, да, — согласился он, — но не идеально. Мы говорим о судьбе волшебного мира, Гермиона, и во имя общего блага должны быть принесены личные жертвы.", "После этой фразы она заметно рассердилась, но Кингсли продолжил:", "— Мы просим всех дееспособных граждан пожертвовать собой ради будущих поколений.", "— Пожертвовать собой? — недоверчиво повторила Гермиона. — Я пожертвовала своё детство войне, и этого недостаточно? Вам нужна ещё и оставшаяся часть моей жизни?", "— Пожертвовала своё детство, — с усмешкой передразнил Малфой. — Мерлин, пощади меня.", "— А твоё украли, — огрызнулась она. — Ты уже отбыл наказание за свои преступления. Так жаждешь получить ещё одно?", "— Смотря какое, — протянул он. — Ты имеешь в виду женитьбу на тебе или возвращение в тюрьму?", "— Любое, — выплюнула Гермиона.", "— Точно подмечено, — сказал Малфой с ухмылкой.", "Гермиона закатила глаза, поворачиваясь обратно к министру.", "— Это абсурдное предложение, Кингсли, в смысле…", "— Двадцать лет…", "— Это минимум за убийство, — возразила она.", "— Может, тогда ты просто убьёшь меня и окажешь нам обоим услугу, — предложил Малфой.", "— Не исключено! — закричала Гермиона.", "— Это не переговоры! — внезапно прогремел Кингсли. Она почувствовала, как подбородок вздёрнулся от удивления. Министр продолжил, понизив голос, но тон звучал не менее сурово: — Вы женитесь или проведёте двадцать лет в Азкабане. Альтернатив нет.", "Он посмотрел на каждого из них по очереди, но никто не произнёс ни слова. Тяжёлый груз безнадёжности снова опустился Гермионе в желудок, когда Кингсли посмотрел на лежащий перед ним законопроект.", "— Ещё, — продолжил он, — был принят во внимание факт, что многие пары будут образованы из незнакомцев. По этой причине после церемонии у вас будут две недели, в течение которых вы сможете познакомиться друг с другом, прежде чем брак официально вступит в силу…", "— Чёртова мерзость, — вспылил Малфой, впервые по-настоящему разозлившись. Гермиона проследила за тем, как он поднялся на ноги и выбежал из кабинета.", "Это было больно.", "Не должно было быть — она и так знала, что он о ней думает, — но было.", "Гермиона никогда не смогла бы представить себе будущее, в котором выйдет замуж за человека, испытывающего к ней отвращение, но через два дня именно это она и делает."], "45541357000": "", "45541357001": ["Последнюю ночь своей свободной жизни Гермиона провела тешась над традициями девичников — в трауре. Развлекаться — это последнее, чего ей хотелось, и она отказалась выходить из дома, но Гарри, Рон и Джинни запретили ей запивать горе в одиночестве. Они пришли через каминную сеть, каждый с бутылкой огневиски в придачу к той, которую Гермиона уже начала пить, и вечер продолжился с удвоенным количеством алкоголя — не такую вечеринку обычно ждёшь в честь столь важного в жизни события.", "Зажатая между Гарри и Роном на диване и рядом с Джинни, сидевшей в кресле, она могла думать только о том, как же странно они смотрелись в её гостиной. Гермиона жила в этом доме одна вот уже три года и не могла вспомнить ни единого раза, когда друзья появлялись бы здесь. Рыжие волосы Уизли ужасно контрастировали с мебельной обивкой цвета хаки, и Гермиона была уверена, что, будь они здесь раньше, она бы заметила. Не то чтобы зрелище казалось чем-то необычным — хотя ни на площади Гриммо, ни в Норе таких диванов не было — просто в сравнении с волшебными местами её дом выглядел как никогда магловским. Гарри же сторонился всего магловского, что могло напомнить ему о пережитом в детстве, и Гермиона не могла винить его за это решение, но теперь казалось, что друзья-волшебники в её доме чувствуют себя не в своей тарелке, и это довольно сильно подчёркивало, каким она по-прежнему оставалась аутсайдером.", "Гермиона взглядом блуждала по комнате, рассматривая обстановку, пока не зацепилась за каминную полку. Три деревянных прямоугольника, блоками сложенных друг на друга, причудливыми шрифтами гласили:", "«Живи.", "Смейся.", "Люби».", "Желудок скрутило, эти слова издевались над ней. Она пережила войну — выжила на войне, развязанной специально ради уничтожения ей подобных. Гермиона больше не смеялась — никто из них, на самом деле, — но оправилась достаточно, чтобы иногда призраки прошлого, что было ею утеряно, меркли и она снова могла почувствовать себя беззаботной. В конце концов, они, конечно, вернутся. Может быть. Глаза заблестели от подступающих слёз: Гермиона оплакивала потерю той любви, о которой не успела даже помечтать, у неё отняли этот шанс. Было бы здорово когда-нибудь, как она думала, влюбиться. Заполучить себе маленькую частичку того чувства, которое спасло их.", "Вместо любви в ней жило постоянное напоминание о прошлом и о том, как принятый ею мир считал её неполноценной. Гермиона ни за что на свете не смогла бы придумать, что же она такого сделала, чтобы заслужить подобное.", "Напольные часы в углу пробили три, и от этого звука по щекам потекли слёзы.", "— Боже, — прошептала она, — у меня заканчивается время.", "— Мы останемся с тобой, — предложил Рон, поворачиваясь на диване и беря её за руку. — На всю ночь.", "Гермиона потрясла головой, чувствуя, как мозг барахтается внутри. Каждый из них выразил сочувствие по-своему: ничего по-настоящему утешающего не было сказано, и всё же поддержка друзей была ценной. Она подумала, что однажды сделает то же самое для них, хотя трудно представить, чтобы кому-то было так же плохо, как ей. Она предположила, что кому-то из мальчиков может достаться Пэнси. Было бы плохо. Не так плохо, как Малфой, но почти.", "Не имея возможности контролировать несколько десятков браков одновременно, Министерство решило объявлять о союзах поэтапно. Гермиона вошла в первую волну. Рон будет в третьей, Джинни — в пятой, а Гарри — в десятой. Все они старались не задумываться, означало ли это, что Гарри и Джинни уже считались далеко не идеальной парой.", "Гермиона зажмурилась — сейчас нет сил оплакивать чужие несчастья.", "— Нет, — прошептала она. — Я должна… постараться уснуть.", "— Тогда мы вернёмся завтра, — сказал Гарри. — Будем с тобой на церемонии.", "— Нет! — Гермиона чуть не закричала. — Я не хочу… — голос дрогнул, — я бы предпочла справиться в одиночку.", "— Ты уверена? — спросила Джинни так тихо, будто Гермиона была чем-то хрупким. — Мы хотим поддержать тебя.", "В ответ Гермиона снова покачала головой, поморщившись, когда комната начала вращаться. Она выходила замуж, но это не свадьба. Это притворство. Чем больше будет помпезности и торжественности, тем хуже она будет себя чувствовать. Это просто следующий шаг, который нужно сделать, прежде чем найти выход.", "— Спасибо вам. Я ценю это, — сказала она так искренне, как только могла заплетающимся языком. — Мне просто… нужно поспать сейчас.", "Буквально сейчас: глаза закрылись ещё до того, как друзья поднялись на ноги. Она смутно ощутила, как кто-то помог ей опуститься на диван, в то время как кто-то другой подложил ей под голову подушку.", "Она глубоко вдохнула через нос, когда до ушей донеслось тихое прощание. Гермиона понадеялась, друзья поймут, что ей не стоит пытаться им ответить.", "Ей просто нужно было провалиться в блаженную, бессознательную темноту.", "***", "Несколько часов спустя ничто уже не казалось ни блаженством, ни темнотой. Гермиона с трудом разлепила веки, застонав, когда стреляющая боль пронзила череп.

Гермиона, пошатываясь, подошла к камину, схватила горсть летучего пороха и, бросив его, направилась в атриум Министерства.", "Зелёное пламя вспыхнуло вокруг, и она, развернувшись, зажала ноздри свободной рукой. Обычный трюк, позволяющий избежать тошноты при перемещении в нетрезвом виде, не сработал, и Гермионе пришлось несколько долгих мгновений прижиматься к блестящей чёрной кафельной стене, когда желчь подступила к горлу.", "— Я так ненавижу сегодняшний день, — простонала она, прижимаясь лбом к прохладной поверхности.", "Но беда в том, что сегодняшний день был лишь началом. Как только состоится церемония бракосочетания, она выйдет замуж. Возможно, на несколько дней, пока они будут пытаться найти выход из положения.", "Гермиона выпрямилась и снова схватилась за голову.

Прямо сейчас ей просто нужно купить себе двухнедельную отсрочку от поездки в Азкабан.", "***", "Дверь в кабинет Кингсли была открыта, и все присутствующие подняли головы, когда Гермиона вошла. Родители Малфоя занимали те же места, что и на последней встрече. Министр сидел за столом, положив подбородок на сцепленные пальцы, а перед ним, рядом с министерским священником, стоял Малфой.", "Когда Гермиона приблизилась, он взглянул на наручные часы, прежде чем пробежаться глазами по её потрёпанному виду.", "— Струсила? — спросил Малфой с притворным сочувствием.", "— Пошёл ты, — огрызнулась она.", "Он ухмыльнулся.", "— Всему своё время, любовь моя.", "— Не называй меня так, — вспылила она.", "— Извини. Жена, — исправился Малфой.", "Гермиона бросилась вперёд, размахивая палочкой и тыча ей ему под подбородок.", "— У меня ещё есть время, чтобы убить тебя, чёрт…", "— Вообще-то, нет, — Кингсли поднялся на ноги. — Мы отстаём от графика, так что, если вы двое закончили… — он замолчал, указывая на священника.", "Глаза Малфоя злобно сверкнули, когда он оглядел Гермиону сверху вниз, притворяясь совершенно равнодушным.", "— Гермиона.", "В голосе Кингсли ясно слышалось предупреждение, и, хотя она сомневалась, что он и правда отправит её в Азкабан за задержку, министр явно больше не был тем человеком, за которого она его принимала.", "Она опустила руку, посмотрев на священника. Тот шагнул вперёд, высокий и худой, в светло-зелёной мантии и с копной густых волос, торчащих прямо из головы. Он был похож на стебель сельдерея. Гермиона решила, что ненавидит его.", "— Не могли бы вы, пожалуйста, встать лицом друг к другу, — начал он певучим голосом.", "Они уже стояли так, поэтому Гермиона бросила сумочку на стол Кингсли, не заботясь о том, что опрокинула банку скрепок. Она вроде как всех ненавидела в этой комнате.", "— Мы собрались здесь, в этот десятый день июля месяца две тысячи первого года, чтобы стать свидетелями соединения…", "Гермиона смотрела прямо перед собой, когда священник начал произносить речь, взгляд был прикован к верхней пуговице чёрной мантии Малфоя. Парадная мантия, как она поняла. Как неловко. Как будто событие того заслуживало. Гермиона была рада, что всё, что Малфой получил от неё, — это растрёпанная причёска и вчерашний джемпер. Это именно то, чего он заслуживал.", "Пока на фоне монотонно звучал голос священника, Гермиона всё больше ощущала дрожь в руках. Она всё ещё держала палочку — они понадобятся для скрепления уз, — но чем сильнее сжимала виноградную лозу в ладони, тем сильнее, казалось, вибрировал кончик.", "Смысл церемонии начал доходить до неё. Такие слова, как честь, доверие, забота, будто заставляли и желудок дрожать.", "Гермиона не смотрела Малфою в лицо, пока…", "— У вас есть кольца?", "Застигнутая врасплох, она подняла взгляд. Никто не упоминал при ней о кольцах. Предполагалось, что она достанет кольцо для Малфоя?", "Но её жених, казалось, совсем не удивился. Он сунул руку в нагрудный карман мантии и вытащил два золотых кольца, одно почти вдвое толще другого.", "Гермиона уставилась на священника, который взмахнул палочкой, шепча заклинание. Они из семейных хранилищ Малфоев? Неужели кто-то купил новые? Откуда он узнал её размер? Чёрт возьми, ей придётся надеть обручальное кольцо.", "Они ярко засветились на мгновение, когда заклинание было произнесено, и священник убрал кольцо Малфоя, оставив на ладони только кольцо для Гермионы.", "— Пожалуйста, повторяйте за мной клятву, когда будете надевать кольцо ей на палец.", "Гермиона побледнела. Неужели им правда нужно произносить клятвы? Разве они не могли просто дать какое-то обычное согласие? Или подписать что-нибудь? Они ведь уже стоят здесь, так? Конечно, этого должно быть достаточно.", "Секунды тикали невероятно громко, пока Гермиона стояла застыв и уставившись на маленькое золотое кольцо. Каждая секунда ощущалась ударом в грудь.", "Священник откашлялся.", "— Если невеста будет любезна…", "Гермиона издала сдавленный звук при слове «невеста», и мужчина, видимо, решил сменить тактику.", "— Пожалуйста, поднимите левую руку, мисс, — мягко сказал он.", "Когда Гермиона подняла руку, та будто налилась свинцом — это движение потребовало от неё каждого грамма имеющейся силы. Малфой сжимал кольцо кончиками пальцев, но рука Гермионы нелепо танцевала между ними от сильной дрожи. Ему пришлось придержать её ладонь волшебной палочкой, чтобы расположить кольцо у кончика безымянного пальца.", "Как только кольцо оказалось там, Гермиона увидела, как Малфой искоса посмотрел на священника. Сама она не осмеливалась встретиться с ним взглядом.", "Священник произнёс первую фразу, и Гермиона закрыла глаза, когда голос Малфоя повторил:", "— Я даю тебе это кольцо как символ своей клятвы…", "…чтобы почитать тебя как свою законную жену…", "…чтобы защищать тебя от любого вреда…", "…чтобы подарить тебе детей…", "…и заботиться о тебе с этого дня до конца дней своих.", "Холодный металл легко скользнул по коже, когда Малфой надел кольцо на палец. Как только он убрал руку, оно стало тёплым и податливым, сжавшись до идеально подходящего размера.", "Священник протянул кольцо Малфоя Гермионе, и она взяла его, чувствуя, как слёзы наворачиваются на глаза.", "— Пожалуйста, повторяйте за мной клятву, когда будете надевать кольцо ему на палец.", "Малфой поднял левую руку на уровень талии, и Гермиона надела кольцо на кончик его безымянного пальца. У неё не получалось удержать кольцо так ровно, как это делал Малфой, и металл не прекращал отскакивать от кожи, как в худшей игре «Операция».Operation Board Game — настольная игра «хирургическая операция»: нужно пинцетом «оперировать» пациента, что с трясущимися руками сделать крайне непросто.", "— Я даю тебе это кольцо как символ своей клятвы… — начал священник повелительным тоном.", "Гермиона открыла рот…", "…но не раздалось ни звука.", "Она уставилась на гладкую бледную кожу руки Малфоя. Идеальное самообладание. Не трясущаяся и не липкая, как у неё. Гермиона была слишком сосредоточена на словах клятвы, чтобы заметить тот факт, что его голос ни разу не дрогнул. Он был спокойным и ровным. Бесчувственным.", "Может быть, он уже давно смирился с этим браком. Может, для него ничего не значило давать клятвы, которые он не имел — не мог иметь — в виду. Но Гермиона не такая.", "Может быть, она никогда по-настоящему и не осознавала этого раньше, но в тот момент она поняла, что мечтала об этом. О том, чтобы пообещать себя кому-то на всю оставшуюся жизнь. Кому-то, кого любила бы и кому доверяла бы больше, чем кому-либо ещё в мире. Кому-то, с кем чувствовала бы себя как дома.", "Но всё это, как и многое другое, принадлежало другому времени и другому миру. Другой жизни, не омрачённой потерями и разрушениями. Гермиона же осталась в жизни этой.", "— Я д-даю тебе это кольцо как с-символ своей клятвы…", "Голос в её собственных ушах никогда не звучал так тихо.", "— …чтобы почитать тебя как своего законного м-мужа…", "…чтобы защищать тебя от любого вреда…", "…чтобы подарить тебе д-детей…", "Гермиона тяжело сглотнула, когда остатки прошлой ночи подступили к горлу. Во рту был привкус виски и смерти.", "— …и заботиться о тебе с этого дня до конца дней с-своих.", "Она судорожно втянула воздух сквозь зубы, произнеся последнюю фразу, и её потные пальцы скользнули по кольцу Малфоя, когда оно сжалось на фаланге его пальца. Он отдёрнул руку и до конца надел кольцо уже сам. Гермиона чувствовала, что вот-вот упадёт в обморок.", "— Пожалуйста, соедините кончики палочек.", "Она подняла палочку. Гермиона держала её так неподвижно, как только могла, но священник всё равно потянулся к их запястьям, чтобы помочь соединить кончики. Она искренне надеялась, что это обычная часть церемонии, а не вынужденная мера из-за того, что Гермиона была на грани срыва.", "Когда они благополучно соединились, бусинка золотого света зажглась между боярышником и виноградной лозой; Гермиона вздрогнула, почувствовав проходящую сквозь неё магию.", "— Властью, данной мне Министерством магии и Магическим декретом 25.2354, я объявляю вас связанными узами брака. Теперь вы можете поцеловаться.", "— Нет, — сорвался с губ Гермионы хриплый стон отчаяния.", "Священник откашлялся и посмотрел за спину Малфою — туда, где сидели Люциус и Нарцисса. Гермиона почти забыла, что они здесь, но увидела, как Люциус коротко кивнул.", "— Приношу свои извинения, — исправился священник. — Теперь вы должны поцеловаться.", "Гермиона впервые посмотрела на Малфоя, думая, что он, конечно же, не согласится на такое унижение. Он посмотрел на неё в ответ, она заглянула ему в глаза, но… там ничего не было. Они были плоскими. Безэмоциональными. Как его голос. Как и его твёрдые руки. Внезапно сердце разбилось так, как она даже не подозревала, что возможно.", "Он был под окклюменцией. Сильной. Вероятно, всё это время. Она только что вышла замуж не просто за человека, который испытывал к ней отвращение, а за человека, который не мог вытерпеть даже собственных эмоций.", "Ничего так не желая, как покончить с этим как можно скорее, Гермиона шагнула вперёд и подняла подбородок, на одну секунду прижавшись сомкнутыми губами к губам Малфоя. Она прислушалась к часам Кингсли. Импульс энергии, похожий на лёгкий электрический разряд, прошёл между ними, и Гермиона отстранилась, когда тот исчез.", "Затем она наклонилась, и её стошнило Малфою на ноги."], "45541357002": "", "45541357003": ["Следующие несколько секунд прошли как в тумане, поскольку одновременно произошло вот что: Гермиона опустилась на пустой стул, Кингсли встал из-за стола и заклятием исчезновения очистил ковёр, священник выбежал из кабинета, а Нарцисса Малфой разрыдалась. Сам Малфой никак не отреагировал, но это, вероятно, было связано с окклюменцией.", "Когда Гермиона вытерла рот рукавом джемпера, трое Малфоев, повернувшись, посмотрели на неё. Она почувствовала себя лучше и смогла широко улыбнуться. Теперь на то, чтобы испытывать к ней отвращение, у них хотя бы имелись веские причины.", "— Ну, — начал Кингсли, опершись руками на стол, — полагаю, можем перейти к следующему пункту. От вас требуется совместное проживание с этого момента и до…", "Гермиона прервала министра:", "— Если вы думаете, что я хоть одной ногой ступлю в Малфой-мэнор…", "Одновременно с ней заговорил Люциус:", "— Если вы думаете, что грязнокровка хоть одной ногой ступит в Малфой-мэнор…", "Гермиона замолчала, когда поняла, что они в унисон сказали почти одно и то же. Когда и Люциус пришёл к такому выводу, лицо его исказилось от недовольства. На такие уступки он был готов, только если дело касалось тюремного заключения.", "— Тогда решено, — самодовольно сказал ублюдок Кингсли. — Гермиона, думаю, у тебя дома найдётся место для мистера Малфоя?", "Она прикусила губу, подумав, как бы на этот раз её не стошнило Кингсли на стол. Однако Гермиона знала, что та магия, которую она теперь чувствовала, которая теперь текла в ней, находилась под заклинанием министерского надзора. Если Гермиона и Малфой попытаются жить отдельно друг от друга, это вскроется, и, если они откажутся от супружеской близости, об этом тоже узнают.", "Как бы Гермионе ни была ненавистна мысль о присутствии Малфоя в её квартире, она понимала, что только так хотя бы один из них будет дома. В любом случае это продлится всего несколько дней.", "— Да, — ответила она наконец, — найдётся.", "— Отлично, — кивнул Кингсли, жестом указывая на камин. — Пожалуйста, не стесняйтесь воспользоваться моим камином.", "Гермиона фыркнула. Скорее, пожалуйста, не стесняйтесь немедленно свалить отсюда.", "Если бы она не чувствовала, как растворяются её внутренности, она бы поддалась искушению задержаться, просто чтобы позлить Кингсли. Но именно это Гермиона и чувствовала, а чем скорее она уйдёт, тем скорее сможет почистить зубы и проспать остаток этого богом забытого дня.", "Она взяла сумку со стола, прежде чем подойти к камину. Кингсли не смотрел ей в глаза.", "Когда Гермиона повернулась, то увидела тихо переговаривающихся Малфоев.", "Нарцисса, казалось, пыталась шёпотом накричать на своего мужа, на её нежных щеках всё ещё были видны следы слёз. Гермиона уловила «это всё твоя вина!», прежде чем Люциус строгим взглядом заставил жену замолчать. Малфой выглядел совершенно несчастным, отчего Гермиона предположила, что он больше не под окклюменцией.", "— Драко, ты должен понять кое-что… — начала Нарцисса.", "— Не сейчас, — Малфой покачал головой.", "— Ты должен выслушать, — настаивала она.", "— Позже, — решительно сказал он. — Мне просто… — он провёл рукой по лицу, — мне просто нужно несколько дней.", "Гермиона нашла, чем себя занять: она несколько раз провела пальцами по зелёной горсти летучего пороха, как будто оценивая его количество. Она подняла глаза, только когда услышала приближающиеся шаги.", "Выражение лица Малфоя старательно возвратилось к надменному, он протянул руки, когда подошёл к ней.", "— Мне перенести тебя через порог?", "Она бросила на него испепеляющий взгляд.", "— Нет, если хочешь сохранить свои яйца.", "Он цокнул языком в притворном разочаровании, взяв горсть летучего пороха.", "— Лучше обойдёмся без этого. Сейчас от этих маленьких приятелей многое зависит.", "Гермиона поморщилась от отвращения, Малфой прошёл мимо неё в камин, и вокруг него вспыхнуло зелёное пламя.", "Затем он поднял палец, как бы раздумывая:", "— Когда я сказал маленьких…", "Гермиона выкрикнула свой адрес, стиснув зубы, когда Малфой унёсся прочь.", "Она дала ему несколько секунд, чтобы успеть посторониться, прежде чем последовать за ним.", "***", "Когда Гермиона вошла в гостиную, первое, что увидела, помимо самого Малфоя, это пустые бутылки из-под виски, всё ещё разбросанные по столу с прошлой ночи. Гермиона тут же поперхнулась, и, хотя зажала рот рукой, Малфой это заметил.", "Его брови ползли вверх, пока он переводил взгляд с неё на бутылки.", "— Что ж, — он широко улыбнулся, — это заставляет меня чувствовать себя намного лучше.", "Гермиона медленно вдохнула, тяжело сглотнув, прежде чем вытащить палочку и убрать бутылки. Малфой рылся в кармане. Его рука исчезла почти до локтя — должно быть, заклинание расширения, — и Гермиона проследила за тем, как он достал маленький чёрный футляр. Малфой положил его на стол и увеличил палочкой. Золотые застёжки со щелчком открылись, он провёл пальцем по множеству флаконов внутри. Остановившись наконец на лиловом, он вытащил флакон из футляра и протянул ей.", "Гермиона сразу узнала зелье от похмелья. Она перевела взгляд на Малфоя, он выгнул бровь, как будто бросая вызов. Рискнёт ли она быть отравленной ради потенциального освобождения от чувства, что она медленно, клеточка за клеточкой, умирает? Стук в её голове выбрал именно этот момент, чтобы усилиться, и Гермиона вытащила пробку, проглотив зелье без лишних раздумий.", "Эффект был мгновенным. Как будто на лоб положили прохладную ткань, а живот обернули пушистым одеялом. Дрожь в руках сразу утихла, и утренний свет больше не вызывал желания выцарапать себе глаза.", "— Спасибо, — вздохнула она, протягивая пустой флакон. Возможно, в Малфое всё-таки была доля сострадания.", "Он забрал флакон, закатив глаза и указывая на свои ботинки.", "— Это было для моего же блага, Гермиона. Это драконья кожа.", "Она изумлённо уставилась на него. Гермиона?", "Он вернул флакон на место, и прикосновением палочки футляр снова уменьшился. Оглянувшись на её молчание, Малфой ухмыльнулся, когда увидел выражение её лица.", "— Ну, я не могу называть тебя Грейнджер, не так ли, миссис Малфой?", "Гермиона снова поперхнулась, её благосклонность исчезла так же быстро, как и похмелье.", "— Не надо… — она задохнулась. — Просто… не надо.", "Он сохранял самодовольство.", "— Я покажу тебе комнату, — отрезала Гермиона, поворачиваясь спиной. Она на мгновение подумала о том, чтобы заставить Малфоя спать на диване, но тогда он всё время попадался бы ей на глаза. А если бы у него была своя комната, он бы сидел там запертым — как на то надеялась Гермиона — большую часть дня.", "Малфой последовал за ней вверх по лестнице, минуя старую комнату родителей, которая оставалась неизменной на случай, если они решат навестить Гермиону, и оказался у двери свободной комнаты — прямо напротив комнаты самой Гермионы.", "— Только эта, — она указала внутрь.", "Он кивнул, заглядывая в дверной проём, слегка сморщив нос.", "— Постельное бельё чистое, — сказала она, словно в защиту.", "Затем Малфой взглянул на неё.", "— Больше, чем я ожидал. Думал, ты прикажешь мне спать в саду за домом.", "Гермиона в глубине души была раздражена, что сама не догадалась до этого.", "— Жаль тебя разочаровывать, но мне нравится проводить время в саду. Я бы предпочла, чтобы ты держался от меня подальше.", "Его губы изогнулись в коварной улыбке, и Гермиона сразу же смирилась с тем, что будет натыкаться на Малфоя всё время его пребывания здесь. Кстати об этом…", "— У тебя с собой вещи? — она неуверенно указала в направлении его расширенного кармана.", "— Эльф принесёт пару чемоданов позже, — ответил он скучающим тоном.", "Она сразу же ощетинилась.", "— Я не потерплю здесь эльфов.", "— Ну, тогда мне всё равно пришлось бы вызвать её сюда, чтобы отменить поручение, так почему бы нам просто не позволить ей разок принести вещи?", "Гермиона стиснула зубы, прекрасно понимая, что каждая секунда, проведённая в присутствии Малфоя, только давала ему дополнительные возможности её раздражать.", "— Хорошо, — выпалила она. — Один раз. После этого я не хочу её здесь видеть.", "— Конечно, — он одарил Гермиону снисходительной улыбкой.", "— Я иду спать, — она резко повернулась к своей двери, — так что была бы признательна за тишину.", "Её догнал саркастически-приторный голос Малфоя:", "— Сладких снов.", "***", "Как оказалось, Малфой — специалист по приготовлению антипохмельного зелья. Когда все симптомы были устранены, Гермиона легко смогла наверстать упущенный ночной сон, а когда проснулась — после особенно сладкого сна, в котором появился Гарри, чтобы сказать ей, что всё это было тщательно спланированным розыгрышем — стояла ночь.", "Гермиона почистила зубы (снова) и переоделась в чистые джинсы и футболку, прежде чем натянуть пару толстых носков. Её ноги постоянно мёрзли — неважно, лето или нет.", "Дверь Малфоя была закрыта — слава Мерлину за небольшие милости, — и Гермиона спустилась по лестнице на кухню. Однако увиденное заставило её замолчать. Быстро сменив благодарность Мерлину на его проклятие, она заглянула Малфою через плечо, он сидел в окружении фигурок, карточек и бумажек пастельного цвета.", "— Что это?", "Он заговорил, даже не отрываясь от листа с инструкциями, который держал в руках:", "— Это игра в недвижимость и собственность. Разной степени ценности, зависит от перемещения по дощечке. Платишь налоги и пошлины вот этой фальшивой валютой. Иногда тебя могут посадить в тюрьму, но не волнуйся, на этот случай есть карточка.", "— Я знаю, что такое монополия, Малфой, — вздохнула Гермиона. — Почему она на моём кухонном столе?", "Он пожал плечами.", "— Дом маленький, и здесь скучно.", "Гермиона закатила глаза, при этом заметив беспорядок вокруг: каждый кухонный шкаф открыт, содержимое разбросано по столу, продукты из кладовой перемешаны.", "Она нырнула за угол, в гостиную, и увидела похожую картину. Все шкафы открыты, книги сняты с полок, игры и пазлы раскиданы по полу.", "— Ты что, весь день рылся в моих вещах? — крикнула она, снова входя в кухню.", "— Теперь это и мои вещи тоже, жена, — спокойно сказал он.", "— Это не так работает!", "Затем Малфой повернулся на стуле, оказываясь лицом к ней, и закинул лодыжку одной ноги на колено другой. Гермиона заметила, что по какой-то причине он всё ещё был одет в парадную мантию.", "— Вообще-то, так, — усмехнулся он, — и я могу придумать около миллиарда причин, по которым ты должна быть за это благодарна.", "Гермиона уставилась на него, нахмурив брови. Она не могла придумать ни одной причины, не говоря уже о миллиарде…", "И тут осознание ударило её, как бладжер в живот.", "Когда она наконец обрела способность говорить, голос был хриплым от негодования:", "— Если ты думаешь, что я прикоснусь хоть к кнату Малфоев, ты, чёрт возьми, сошёл с ума.", "— Осмеливаюсь предположить, что ты образумишься.", "— Ах ты осмеливаешься? — она передразнила его дурацкий жеманный акцент. — Хорошо, как насчёт того, чтобы больше не говорить ничего подобного?", "Любая реплика, которую он мог бы выдать, оказалась прервана громким треском, и глаза Гермионы расширились при виде домового эльфа, появившегося на кухне. В пуховой белой наволочке и с кружевной каймой, завязанной, как ленты, у основания ушей.", "— Нилли отнесла чемоданы в спальню хозяина, — объявила она писклявым голосом.", "— Спасибо, Нилли, — Малфой поднялся на ноги. — Это моя жена Гермиона.", "— Перестань называть меня… — она замолчала, не желая показаться грубой. — Привет, Нилли, — улыбнулась Гермиона, слегка наклоняясь, — очень приятно с тобой познакомиться.", "— О, хозяйка! — воскликнула Нилли. — Какое счастье быть мной, — она поклонилась так низко, что её уши почти коснулись пола.", "— Пожалуйста, скажи ей, чтобы она не называла меня хозяйкой, — тихо попросила Гермиона Малфоя.", "— Сама ей скажи, — ответил он, — она теперь и тебе подчиняется.", "Гермиона в нарастающем ужасе переводила взгляд с Малфоя на маленького эльфа. Заставить того выполнять приказы Малфоя в её доме — это одно, но разделить над живым существом собственность — совсем другое.", "— Ни в коем случае, — решительно заявила Гермиона, наклоняясь, чтобы снять один из своих носков. Она протянула его эльфу, но Нилли завизжала, как будто тот был сделан из дьявольского пламени.", "— Нет! — она нырнула за Малфоя, хватаясь за его мантию. — Пожалуйста, только не одежда! — Нилли разразилась истерическими рыданиями.", "Гермиона в шоке уставилась на то, как Малфой немедленно опустился на одно колено и прижал эльфа к себе.", "— Пожалуйста, сэр! — продолжала она плакать. — Нилли заботится о вас с тех пор, как вы были младенцем! Что угодно, только не одежда! Нилли сделает всё что угодно!", "— Ну-ну, — Малфой нежно похлопывал эльфа по крошечным плечам, которые вздымались от рыданий. — Она ничего такого не имела в виду, Нилли. Не нужно брать одежду, если она тебе не нужна.", "— Она не знает ничего лучше… — возмущённо начала Гермиона, но замолчала под предупреждающим взглядом Малфоя.", "— Хозяйка была хозяйкой всего один день, — всхлипнула Нилли, — а Нилли уже вызывает у неё недовольство.", "— Нет, нет, — серьёзно сказала Гермиона, — ты не сделала ничего плохого, Нилли. Хозяй… О, ради Мерлина, я вовсе не недовольна.", "Нилли прижалась щекой к груди Малфоя, моргая затуманенными глазами.", "— Хозяйка довольна Нилли?", "Гермиона вздрогнула, но Малфой многозначительно откашлялся.", "— Да, — выдавила она. — Я очень довольна. На самом деле, я так рада, что хотела подарить тебе этот носок в качестве награды…", "— Грейнджер, — предупредил Малфой, когда Нилли судорожно втянула воздух.", "— Н-но, возможно, мы сможем обсудить это позже, — закончила Гермиона со слабой улыбкой.", "Глаза Нилли стали ещё круглее, если это было возможно, и она поспешно заговорила с Малфоем:", "— Хозяин, пожалуйста, позовите Нилли, если понадобится что-нибудь ещё. — Затем она трансгрессировала, по-видимому, прежде, чем Гермиона смогла решить, что позже — это сейчас.", "— Что ж, отличная работа, — выплюнул Малфой, поднимаясь на ноги. — Очень тактично.", "— Не говори мне о тактичности, — огрызнулась она. — Я не та, кто будет принимать участие в порабощении. Это подло!", "Он шагнул вперёд, чтобы прошипеть ей прямо в лицо:", "— Тебе кто-нибудь когда-нибудь говорил, что ты звучишь как долбаная идиотка, когда притворяешься, будто знаешь всё на свете?", "— О таком я знаю достаточно!", "— Нет, не знаешь! — закричал он. — Некоторые части этого мира ты никогда по-настоящему не поймёшь, как бы сильно ни старалась, и я не позволю твоему грубому невежеству терроризировать кого-либо, кто находится под моей опекой!", "— Моему невежеству?! — недоверчиво повторила она. — Да это из-за тебя невежество вообще существует, высокомерный придурок! Некоторые части твоего мира я не хочу понимать. Свобода — это правильно, а рабство — неправильно, это ты понимаешь?", "Он прищурился, глядя на неё.", "— С каждой секундой всё больше и больше.", "Её ногти впились в мягкий хлопок носка, который она всё ещё держала в руках, но прежде чем Гермиона успела ответить, Малфой повернулся на каблуках и ушёл. Она стояла там, тяжело дыша от ярости и прислушиваясь к его шагам. Гермиона не двигалась, пока не услышала звук хлопнувшей двери спальни."], "45541357004": "", "45541321000": "Fictional Obsessions\n            “Oi, Pads! Padfoot! Sirius!”            “Mate, what the fuck?”, Sirius scowled.            “Not my fault, you didn't answer me.” James threw his hands up in defence, which had previously tossed his half-eaten pastry at Sirius's head. “If you stopped drooling over lover boy for a second and paid attention to me, your best friend, by the way, it'd be much appreciated.”            “I wasn't drooling, and I told you to stop calling him that. What if he heard you?”            “He's way too engrossed into that Muggle novel of his to listen to us.”            “He doesn't listen to you guys whether he's reading or not - you generally only have bullocks to say, anyways, Prongs.”, Peter chimed in.            “Oi, that really hurt, Wormie. Why are you suddenly stabbing us in the back, huh?” James clenched at his chest, as if Peter had actually poked him with a knife.            “Just stating the facts, James. You know Moony, don't you?”, Peter countered.            “Yeah, I do. Still - Pads, when will you finally talk to him about...” He gesticulated in a way that’s usually only seen on the Quidditch grounds.            “Piss off, Prongs. I am not talking about this again, just ‘cause you have some weird fantasy about being... what did you call it? ‘Couple-besties’?” Peter choked on his pumpkin juice trying to hold back his laugh and failing miserably. That got Remus’s attention.            “What’re you guys on about? Pete, are they bickering again?” Peter didn’t get the chance to answer.            “Glad you asked, Moony.  Because Sirius was just gonna tell you that...”Sirius made use of the recently weaponized pastry and stuffed James’s face with it to interrupt the meddler from embarrassing him any further.            “... James still hasn’t finished his Charms essay and can’t wait to spend the next two hours with Ms Pince, where he won’t be able to utter another sound. Sounds like a bloody lovely idea, Mr Prongs! I simply cannot wait to see what you come up with. It will surely send Flitwick to the moon. Off you go!” With that, Sirius pushed James away from the breakfast table and into the halls, not without flipping him off. James’s laughter could be heard through the wooden door, and Remus’s face bore an expression that could only be translated to ‘I don’t believe any of the bullshit you just tried to sell me, but I am simply too tired of it to care so I’m gonna play along’.            “Well alright.”, he asked once Sirius had returned to the Great Hall. “Have you finished your Charms essay, Pads?”, Remus asked, an eyebrow raised. A look that made Sirius go to Heaven and crash back down within two seconds, but God forbid James from ever finding out about that, let alone Remus himself.            “Of course, I have, my dear Moony. You know I take my classes very seriously. Who do you think I am?” Arms crossed in front of his chest, he turned his face away from Remus, chin held high, trying to keep up the pretended offense. Secretly, the corner of his mouth was twitching, as was Remus’s, but how are they to know?            “Well excuse my accusation, dear Padfoot, but I am not really used to your remarkable academic behaviour. That might be caused by the fact that it took you six years to come to the conclusion that you could actually achieve decent marks once you rose to your full potential.”, Remus teased.            “It still amazes me how you always find the possibility to insult and compliment me in the same sentence. You’re just so eloquent, it’s impressive.” Remus laughed, which was Sirius’s favourite sound in the entire world. Cheesy? Yes. Didn’t mean it wasn’t true.            “If you read past the required amount we are assigned in class, you might pick up some of that eloquence.” His laughter turned into a small smile. Peter just stood there, admiring the way his two friends interacted with each other. He was not one to tease people with something like that. He loved regarding it from the outside, watching their relationship bloom into whatever it was supposed to be.            “Oh, I do read past our assignments. I read the stuff that matters.” Sirius blushed; Remus didn’t notice. “Sure you do, Pads. Next time I need to know the song order of ‘The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars’, I’ll come to you.”            “Hey! That is a phenomenal album! And don’t act like you disagree. In fact, I’m gonna go up to the dorm and listen to it right now. You wanna come?”, Sirius pressed.            “Okay, okay. I accept my defeat. That sounds like a lovely plan. Pete, you gonna join us?” Remus brought his attention back to the other Marauder.            “Nah, I’m good. You guys go ahead. The girls invited me to their study session, and we’re gonna discuss the latest news Lily has on her sister. See you later!” With that, Peter was off to the library.            “He’s really invested in all the Petunia gossip by now, isn’t he?”, Sirius asked while watching him leave the Great Hall.            “I think it’s nice. I guess he likes to talk to people who can relate to having a sister at home. The last couple of months with Desdemona haven’t been easy on him. He misses her a lot.”            “Yea, you’re probably right. Plus – more Padfoot-Moony-time for us.” Sirius smirked at Remus, hoping he took his sincere excitement for sarcasm.            “That’s true, Pads. Now I have to endure your presence completely and utterly alone.” That cheeky bastard. Remus made his way to their dorm room.            “Hey! My presence is a delight to everyone!” He shouted after the werewolf on his way through the castle, but Remus just smiled to himself while covertly enjoying Sirius’s attention.            “Ever so humble, Sirius.”            “Don’t know how to do it any other way.” * * *\n \n            “Stupid Padfoot and his stupid fear of his love for Moony, now I actually have to do my stupid Charms essay.” James had been grumbling all the way to the library.            “James! I’ve been looking all over for you!” And suddenly his bad mood disappeared immediately.            “Lils, hey! Why, I could really grow fond of this kind of greeting. How can I brighten your day, Ms Evans?”, James smiled.            “Oh, stop acting so smug, Potter.” Despite her statement, she couldn’t hold back the smile that was creeping onto her face herself. She gave him a quick peck on the lips and James’s smile got even goofier. “Pete told me what happened at breakfast. And fate has it, I also haven’t finished my Charms essay yet, ‘cause of the tutoring. You wanna have a go at it together?”            “Well, how could I deny an offer like that?”, he replied cheekily.            “Oh, buzz off, I wasn’t talking about that. But if you won’t be able to concentrate, I’ll just write the essay by myself.” She, too, was now smirking.            “No, no, fine. I’ll behave – I won’t be able to finish it myself, anyway. I just can’t get behind Ascendio, why do we need this kinda stuff anyway? We all know how to use brooms, don’t we?”             “Stop whining like a child. And also – you don’t always have your broom with you, do you? What if you’re in some kind of trouble? I think it could be useful.”, Lily retorted.            “Suppose that’s true. See, you helped me already. What did I do to deserve such an amazing girlfriend, huh?”, he asked, enveloping her in a bear hug.            “I ask myself that very question every day, James.” She looked up at him lovingly, kissing him more properly this time.             “C’mon, Peter and the girls are waiting in the library, and we need an update on the lover-boy-situation. Marlene has been bugging me all morning and I promised her we would have a proper discussion after the study session. Plus, it might lighten my mood after the latest episode of ‘My Sister Is Still Not Able to Cope with Me Being a Witch, While She Is Not.’” Lily grinned crookedly at her boyfriend while grabbing his hand and dragging him down the hall towards the library.            “Lily, wait. Do you wanna talk about it?”            “I’m fine, really. And we will talk about it, but Marlene is gonna end our friendship if I don’t include her in the updates.”            “Fine, fine. The library it is then.” James followed her through the halls, squeezing her hand just a little tighter.             “Finally, you made it! I’ve been on the edge of my seat all day. Lemme hear the hot Gryffindor-gossip!” Marlene grabbed Lily’s hand from James’s and dragged her onto the seat next to her.            “Nice to see you, too, Marls. I have to disappoint you, though. Charms essay first, gossip later. Lily’s orders.” James stifled a laugh as he saw Marlene’s exasperated expression. Her and Sirius had a lot in common when it came to stuff like that.            “Oh, bugger off, Evans. You know exactly where my priorities lie, and if I want to be able to ascend to the surface when I’m underwater, you know what I’ll do? Swim.”, she snarled.            “Stop whining like a child. And also – you might not always be able to rely on your physical abilities, will you? What if you’re in some kind of trouble? I think it could be useful.” Sometimes, like now, apparently, James really liked to show off his Gryffindor courage, because according to the look on Lily’s face, he might as well fight a Hungarian Horntail. He really liked that look.Marlene, Mary, Dorcas, and Peter silently accepted their non-verbal interaction, knowing they did not want to understand everything that was going on between the couple.            “Anyway – given I agree with both of the parties present, how ‘bout we start with the essay and then continue to the gossip. I’ve the introduction already and Dorcas finished the definition of the spell. So, you guys go ahead and copy that while we continue with the rest, sound good?” Peter looked questioningly at the others.            “That’s very kind of you, guys. Sounds like a plan. Let’s get started!”, Lily agreed. And so, they followed Peter’s plan. Marlene and James simultaneously discussed the upcoming Quidditch match against Ravenclaw, while Peter and Lily interestedly listened to Dorcas’s newest eye-liner tactic that made getting ready with her girlfriend a lot easier. Marlene liked to complain a lot when she didn’t succeed in creating the perfect wing, which had caused Dorcas to lose a lot of her nerves very early in the morning. “Scotch tape – as simple as that. Who would’ve thought?”, she sighed, and joined Peter and Lily’s laughter.            “Done! We’re done! Flitwick’s gonna... well, he’s gonna have to deal with it, there’s only so much I can do.” Marlene dramatically dropped her quill onto the table, nearly spilling the ink and receiving a scowling glance form Dorcas, which she just shrugged off by blowing her a kiss. “Now gossip!” ***\n \n\nAnd he was alright, the band was altogetherYes, he was alright, his song went on foreverAnd he was awful niceReally quite paradiseAnd he sang all night, all night long…\n\n \nBowie’s voice flowed through the Marauders’ dorm room, while Remus and Sirius sat on the floor in front of the former’s bed. Their thighs were touching, and both had their eyes closed, enjoying the music that came from the record player.            “You think we’ll ever be able to see him live?”, Sirius queried, keeping his eyes closed and his head back.            “He’s a show scheduled in Brixton in December. Would be pretty cool to be there, wouldn’t it, Moony?”            “Yea, maybe we’ll get our hands on some tickets. I’ll have to look up how close it is to the moon, though.”, Remus answered.            “The concert’s on the 2nd, the moon’s not until the 14th, so you should be fine.”             “You know the date of the full moon ‘til December?”            “Sure do. Why do you seem so surprised?” Sirius opened his eyes and looked at him, genuinely wondering.            “Well, it’s April. I don’t even know the date in December.”            “Oh, well… I guess… I care about you, and I want to be able to support you as well as possible. I mean, we all do, Prongs and Wormtail…” Well, bloody awesome, Sirius thought to himself. Great safe. Didn’t seem like a stalker at all. Where’s the nearest wall to put my head through?That didn’t seem to be necessary, though. Remus was not freaking out. He was… was he flustered?            “Oh, that’s… that’s really kind, Padfoot. I appreciate that.” He looked down into his lap and started fiddling with his hands.Did he make him nervous? No, that couldn’t be.            “Are you coming to Hogsmeade with us this weekend?”, Remus changed the subject.            “Absolutely! Can’t leave you alone with a heart-eyed James Potter while roaming the streets, can I? Also: didn’t Collin tell you last week that Flourish and Blotts were getting a new shipment of Muggle novels? Can’t let you miss out on that.” Remus looked a bit stunned. “Yea, he did. Their supplier’s just discovered an abandoned library in the countryside – most of the books were still intact. I didn’t think you’d remember that.”, Remus wondered.            “Well, sure I did. It’s also all you’ve been talking about since you’ve found out.”, he stated.            “Oh, sorry. I didn’t realize that. Tell me next time, I don’t want to bore you with stuff like that.”, Remus rambled, suddenly self-conscious. That wasn’t Sirius’s intention. He didn’t like that at all.            “No need to apologize, Moony. I like listening to you talk; especially when you talk about things you’re excited about.”, Sirius reassured him. Remus just looked at him, but then Sirius could see the worries leaving his eyes. He smiled, and who was Sirius to not immediately mirror Remus in that. “Thanks, Pads. That’s nice of you to say.”            “Of course, you never need to worry about anything with me, I hope you know that. If not, I’ll gladly remind you.” He poked Remus into the side before standing up, crossing the room to turn the record. Had he remained sat, he would have seen the blush that crept onto Remus’s cheeks.            “So, should we say 11?”, Sirius said.            “Hm?”, was the confused answer he received from his friend.            “Saturday, Hogsmeade. Should we tell the others we wanna leave at 11?”, Sirius answered.            “Uh, yea, sure. That sounds good.”, Remus stuttered.              “Great, I’ll tell James and Pete when they get back from the library.”Sirius sat back down. They silently listened to the album, comfortable next to each other. ***             “… And then he interrupted me by telling Remus I still had to finish my Charms essay, that coward.” James had just finished summarizing this morning’s event – very detailedly, one must say. Just like Marlene had insisted.            “My god, will he ever make a move? You can’t tell me he doesn’t see the way Remus looks at him. How is it possible for him to be overconfident in literally every other situation he’s in, but when it comes to his Moonbeam,” – Marlene faked a gag while imitating Sirius, which caused James to laugh and receive a disciplinary look from Ms Pince to shush him – “he’s like a child hiding behind his mother’s skirt. Which is ironic, really, ‘cause I don’t think his mother ever let him do that.” That gained another laugh from the whole group.            “Yes, exactly. At this point, I can’t stand the tension anymore – romantic and sexual, in case you were wondering.”, James added exasperatedly.            “Thanks, James,” Marlene rolled her eyes. “we weren’t. We’re all very aware of the sexual tension.” James gave an apologetic shrug.            “Anyway – do you guys really think it’s any of your business to meddle with other people’s relationships?”, Lily chimed in.            “Absolutely. Watching the two of them has become awfully painful. We’d be doing them a favour.” It was obvious that Marlene was very sure of her opinion.            “Exactly.”, James agreed. “Also, meddling is totally fine when you have only the best intentions for the meddlees.”            “Is that so?”, Dorcas asked, an eyebrow raised.            “Yes, absolutely. It is a well-known fact.” Marlene’s answer was supported by James vigorously shaking his head yes.            “Fine.” Lily and Dorcas have known their partners for far too long to try to talk them out of their more or less insane plans. They had their game faces on, which meant retreat was the best strategy for peace. “But we’ll let you know when you’ve gone too far.”            “Sure, you do that.” James and Marlene exchanged a knowing glance that told their girlfriends all they needed to know.            “Peter, what do you think about all this?”, James asked, searching for another supporter to help them execute their mission.            “Oh no, Prongs. This one’s all yours. I’m not interfering with other people’s relationships, and especially not one involving Moony. I’m not too overly fond of the possible consequences. And I’m certain they’ll get there sooner or later.” Fine, Peter had made up his mind. Marlene it was, then.            “Pff, traitor. Okay, Marlene: we need to draw out our mission plan. Meet me in the Prefect’s Bathroom in two hours. I still need to brainstorm some ideas before we start.” James took things like these very seriously.            “Alright, sounds good. I’ll do the same, see you in two hours, Potter. Bye, guys.” ***\n \n            “James?! Where did you put my fucking shirt?” Nice words to wake up to on a beautiful Saturday morning. But hey, Sirius was not complaining if it correlated with a shirtless Remus Lupin, scoldingly going through is closet.            “Oi, chill mate. I didn’t have it.”, James retorted from the bathroom.            “Why’s it not in here, then? You knew I was gonna wear it today.”            “Which one are you talking about again?” James exited the bathroom, toothbrush in his mouth and glasses still foggy from the shower.            “The green one with the brown stripes.”, Remus answered.Oh oh. Sirius pulled his blanket up, trying to hide the fact that he might or might not be wearing… said shirt. Could you blame him? It was lying on the floor last night, and he picked it up to put it into Remus’s closet, but it was so soft. And it smelled of him. So, he put it on, not even thinking about what this might convey. How was he gonna get out of this?            “I didn’t see it either. Sorry, Moony.”, Peter chimed in.     “Great. Well, I’ll just have to wear something else then, won’t I?” Sirius couldn’t help but smile. Grumpy Remus was hot.He grabbed a random button down from his closet and disappeared             into the bathroom. Sirius took the chance to lose the shirt and hide it underneath his pillow. James and Peter, of course, noticed. Peter smirked at him knowingly, while James seemed to be on the verge of letting Remus in on their little revelation. Sirius was on him in a second.            “If you so much as think about it, I’ll tell Lily about August 2nd.”, Sirius threatened.            “You wouldn’t!”, James’s pupils elated, and his mouth hung open, as if he couldn’t fathom his best friend’s betrayal.            “Oh, you know I would.”, Sirius taunted. Peter started laughing, clearly entertained by their game of blackmail.            “Fine, but can you at least admit to yourself that you’re a complete and utter lost cause?”, James pressed.            “Yea… yea, I know.” Sirius knew he had to accept at least one defeat this morning. At that point, the door to the bathroom was opened.            “Okay, guys. I’ll wait in the Common Room ‘til you’re ready.”Sirius was rather glad he stole Remus’s shirt. He looked bloody good with this one’s sleeves rolled up.He must’ve been staring, because James slamming his elbow into his side brought him back from his Moony-themed-daydreams.            “Uh, yea. I’ll be right down.”, Sirius agreed, once again reduced to a stuttering mess.Remus just smiled at him, rather smugly, if you asked him.    “Great. You should put on some eyeliner; you haven’t worn that in a while. It looks really rather good on you.” As if that suggestion alone wasn’t enough, Remus had the audacity to wink, before making his way to the Common Room, leaving James stunned, Peter trying to hold back his laughter, and Sirius absolutely wrecked.            “Did… did you guys just see that or was it part of my imagination?” Sirius most definitely needed an affirmation.            “No, no, it was real alright.”, James grinned.            “Awesome, great, I’m just gonna… fuck, fuck, fuck.” With that, he stumbled into the bathroom. ***             “So where do we go first?”, Peter wanted to know. “I need to stock up on Chocolate Frogs, so I definitely wanna go to Honeyduke’s, but I don’t think that should be our first stop. What do you guys wanna do?” He looked at the group.            “Moony wants to go to Flourish and Blotts, right?”, Sirius answered while looking at Remus.            “Yes, but you lot don’t have to come. I can go there on my own and meet you afterwards.”            “Nonsense, I already told you I was coming, and you guys can come too. Wouldn’t hurt you to be among some books from time to time.” That gained Sirius a blow on the back of his head from Lily. James chuckled. “You’re one to talk, Black. When was the last time you picked up a book? I don’t think I’ve ever even seen you set foot into the library.” Hand on her hips, she challenged Sirius.            “Hey! I’ll have you know that I read tons of books, just not the ones you can find in our library.” Sirius looked at the ground, almost sheepishly, which made Lily drop it. James could see that she was just as curious as him, though.            “Fine. But yes, of course we’ll come to Flourish with you, Remus. I haven’t had the chance to pick up new Muggle novels in ages, and I’m dying to see their new books. What about the rest of you guys?” Lily turned towards Peter, Marlene, and Dorcas. They were all nodding their heads, and James would obviously be coming if Lily wanted to browse through a bookshop. She always got so excited when she found something she knew from home or a new one she was interested in. It was wonderful to see the spark in her eyes, adorable really.            “Great, then let’s go.”, she announced.Admittedly, James had another reason to join Sirius and Remus. Marlene and his plan needed to be set into motion, and the pair thought Hogsmeade to be the perfect opportunity.Having arrived at the bookstore, Dorcas and Peter found their way to the café part of the shop, where they sat down in a corner to enjoy their coffees and to chat. Marlene and James, on the other hand, had work to do.They had done their research – James had spent the last few days learning about the kind of books Remus liked to read. Authors that were found on his shelves multiple times, novels he had annotated quite thoroughly, copies that were worn out because they had clearly been read several times... and now it was their job to make Sirius find similar stories he could give to Remus. Then he would think Sirius spent all this time getting to know his interests, realize his dedication and thus, his undying love for the werewolf. They would grossly make out and live happily ever after. The ending. Fool proof, really. They were geniuses.What they hadn’t accounted for, though, was Sirius’s actual knowledge of Remus’s interests and his actual dedication.            “Moony, they have ‘Anne of Avonlea’! Have you read that one yet or just the first part?” Sirius seemed to be honestly excited to have found the book.            “That’s great, thanks, Pads. No, I’ve only read the first one. I’d love to dive back into the world at Green Gables, though. This is great.”, Remus looked equally excited.            “Same – I was so crushed after Matthew’s death that I couldn’t bear to read any more of it. But I think I’ve come to terms with it, now.”, Sirius said solemnly, which made Remus laugh. “Okay, Pads. I didn’t know you were so fond of the small Canadian girl.”, he answered.            “How could I not be? She is a wonderful person. Do you remember the time when she...” At that, James tuned out. His two best friends were now deep into reminiscing about the Muggle book he knew absolutely nothing about.            “Marlene?” The blonde had been standing next to him throughout the scene that played out in front of them. “Yes?”            “Did you put him up to this?” James looked at her questioningly.            “Nope, I was gonna ask you the same thing. Does Sirius actually... read? And the same books as Remus does? Is this a strange discovery or is it just me?”            “Well, come to think of it, it doesn’t surprise me that much. Sirius is head over heels for our Moony, it only makes sense for him to get to know the stuff Remus likes so he can talk to him about it.”, James said thoughtfully.            “Yea, I guess that makes sense. But where does this leave us? Sirius basically implemented our plan without even fucking knowing.”            “Well, let’s just see how this trip goes, and if they’re still not closer to being a disgustingly cute couple at the end of the day, we’ll figure out a new tactic.”, James suggested.            “Sounds like a plan, Potter. Plus, now we can spend more time with our girlfriends.” Marlene wriggled her eyebrows and put on a goofy grin.            “Yes, true, Marls. I think I’ve seen Lily with five books already. Gotta make sure she only buys as much as we can actually carry back.” With that, they were off to the others, leaving Remus and Sirius to themselves. ***\n \n“How ‘bout this one?”“Oh, I’ve already got that one.”“I know, but your copy looks like it could use a break. How often have you read it?”, Sirius teased.“Fuck off, I really like it, so? Is it a crime to read a book multiple times?”, Remus defended himself.“No, it’s not, my dear Moonbeam. And I get it, it is a great story.”, Sirius gave in.“Right? It’s somehow tragic and romantic from the beginning to the ending. You know they’ll find each other, but you don’t allow yourself to hope that they’ll stay with each other. And when they actually do, it makes it so much more exciting...” Remus rambled on for another few minutes before they discovered the next story they could share thousands of thoughts about. Sirius could listen to him all day. The love and passion Remus had for these characters, these places, these adventures – it was simply mesmerizing to watch him theorize about them.             “Okay, we’re done.”, Lily announced. Her and Remus had both found seven books each they just had to buy, James. You don’t know what you’re missing out on. I’ll make you read them one day.            “Yea? And what do I get if I do?”, James had replied, to which Lily just whispered something in his ear that made him go as red as a tomato. Sirius was very thankful for not having heard what she had said. He loved them both, dearly. But he didn’t need to know everything.            “You’ve got yourself a deal, babe.”, James answered while beaming.After leaving Flourish and Blotts, they made their way to Honeyduke’s where Peter got to buy some Chocolate Frogs as promised.They let their day end at the Three Broomsticks before slowly returning to the castle.            “This was really nice, I had a great time.”, Marlene said, once they were all gathered in the Common Room.            “Yea, it was, Marls. But now I’m knackered. I definitely need some sleep. Good night, guys.” Sirius got up to make his way up the stairs.            “Same for me. See you lot tomorrow.”, Remus said, while getting up as well.            “Wait for me, guys. I’m so exhausted I can’t even...”, Peter started before he was rudely interrupted by James grabbing his wrist and pulling him back down onto the sofa. “Pete, didn’t you want to show me the new Chocolate Frog cards you’ve gotten today?”, James demanded, staring at the poor Peter insistingly.            “What are you talking about, Prongs? I didn’t...” Sirius was going to kill him. James, that is. He was not exactly the king of subtlety. “Ooh, yes. Sure, I remember now. Yes, let me just get them from my coat.”, Peter finally complied, while Sirius just shot a death stare towards his best friend. He didn’t seem bothered by that, at all. Sirius could feel Remus grinning behind his back and decided to put an end to his own misery.            “Alright, you people have fun with that. Moony, you coming?”            “Right behind you, Padfoot. Night guys.” Once in their dorm, Sirius threw himself face-down onto his bed, grunting into his pillow.            “You okay there, Pads? Got something you wanna get off you your chest?”, Remus asked, more mocking than concerned.            “Nope, absolutely nothing. I’m fine, everything is bloody great.”, he said as he stood up to go to the bathroom.            “Alright, if you say so.” Remus moved his head to the side; apparently, he was rather amused by Sirius’s obvious misery.In the bathroom, Sirius ruffled his hair and just stared into the mirror for several minutes. Okay, might as well tell him. He knows, and if he doesn’t’, he at least knows something’s off. Rip off the band aid and don’t be such a baby about it. What could go wrong? I mean, you could ruin a lifelong friendship to one of the most important people in your world, but who’s got time to worry about that? Pish posh, everything’s going to be just fine. So yes, he was determined to confess his love to Remus Lupin. Behind this bathroom door was a new era. The era of ‘Remus Lupin knows Sirius Black is completely head over heels for him.’ – and it was up to Remus Lupin and Remus Lupin only to decide how peaceful this era was going to be. But Sirius was fine, he wasn’t freaking out at all.So, like the brave hero he was, he opened the door. On the other side, he saw Remus. That was to be expected. What was not be expected was him holding up Sirius’s sleepshirt. Well, Remus’s shirt, technically. The green one with brown stripes. Sirius stood still. Retreat, retreat, retreat!            “Pads, why was my shirt under your pillow?”, Remus challenged.            “Well... that’s a funny story, actually.” What happened to retreating?            “Don’t let me miss out on all the fun, then. Tell me.”, Remus responded while coming closer.            “Huh, ehm... yes, of course. So, I found your shirt on the floor last night.”            “Mhm.”            “... and I was going to put it back in your closet, but...”            “But what, Padfoot?” Remus had crossed the dorm room and was standing right in front of him. Teasing.            “But it was really soft, and...” Yep, this was rock bottom.            “But?” Remus was not letting this go.            “But... it smelled like you, so I used it as a sleepshirt.”, Sirius whispered sheepishly, looking at the floor to avoid Remus’s piercing gaze.Remus put his fingers to Sirius’s chin, lifting up his face and making him meet his eyes. Sirius was paralyzed.            “I’ll take that as a compliment.”, Remus muttered. With that, Remus closed the space between them. Sirius was unable to move for exactly two seconds, before he started kissing him back. He moved his hands to Remus’s neck and clung onto him like his life depended on it.Their kiss got fiercer, giving them the possibility to release several years’ worth of intense pining.After pulling apart, Sirius didn’t dare to open his eyes. He was scared to wake from this beautiful dream he’s had since Fifth Year.            “Pads?”            “Yea?”            “Can you open your eyes for me?”, Remus whispered.Who was he to refuse him.            “You kissed me.”, Sirius said.            “I did.”, Remus answered.            “Why did you do that?”, he asked.            “I think I couldn’t stand to be patient anymore. Restrained myself long enough.” At this, Sirius looked genuinely dumbfounded.            “You’ve restrained yourself from kissing me?”            “Mhm.” Remus nodded.            “Since when?”            “Remember the day when we went to that beach together while we were staying at Prongs’s for the summer holidays three years ago?”            “Oh.”            “Yes, oh.”            “But Moony, I was just planning to confess my undying love to you!”, Sirius whined. “And now you stole my thunder!”            “Oh, did I?” Remus threw his head back while laughing. “I’m sorry, my dearest Padfoot. Do go on, though. I’m always open for people confessing their undying love for me.”, he teased.            “What? Who else is in love with you? Is it that Ravenclaw you talked to in the library last week?” Sometimes, Sirius was rather gullible.            “Pads...” Remus frowned at him.            “Oh, right. You were joking. Ha ha, sure, make fun of me while I’m pouring my heart out to you.”            “Oh, come here, you big cry baby.” Remus took his hand and led them to his bed where they sat down next to each other. Sirius didn’t let go of his hand. He laid his head onto Remus’s shoulder.            “I really do like you, Moony, you know? You’re my favourite person.”, he confessed timidly.            “I really like you, too, Pads. You’re my favourite person as well.” Sirius looked up at Remus and kissed him, his hands on his cheeks.            “I’m guessing James knows, too?”, Remus stated with a small smile on his lips.            “Yea, not exactly subtle, this one.”, Sirius muttered a little frustratedly. “I’m so gonna tell Lily about August 2nd.” At this, Remus laughed earnestly.            “So, did he set you up to reading all my favourite books?”            “What?” Sirius looked at him. Lines of confusion marking his face.            “Well, I realized that you’ve been reading all the books I’m reading so I guessed James figured out some sort of scheme to help you make a move on me.” Remus didn’t seem offended, but somehow it hurt Sirius that he thought that was all there was to it.            “No, absolutely not! I’ve been telling him to knock it off with those plans of his. Him and Marlene have been driving me fucking insane, they’re relentless. You’ve got no idea.”, Sirius complained.            “Oh, I’ve got some idea.”, Remus smiled. Sirius couldn’t see it, though. “Why did you read my books, then? I didn’t think you would be interested in them.”At this, Sirius hesitated. “If I tell you, you have to promise me not to laugh.”            “I solemnly swear.”, Remus promised smugly.            “Ha ha, come on, I’m not joking.”            “Okay, yes. I won’t laugh. Now tell me.”            “Well, I’ve always enjoyed watching you read. You seem completely at peace, with yourself and the world. You’re usually so worried about so many things. But when you’re reading, it looks like you’re forgetting about all the weight that has been put onto your shoulders because you allow yourself to simply explore the worlds you read about. And I love when you tell me about the adventures you experience with every book. You’re eyes always light up, and you get so excited you can’t stop talking about the new characters you just fell in love with. And then I thought I should read these books as well so I could understand and support your passionate rambles as well as possible.”When Sirius looked back at Remus, he saw pure adoration in his eyes. “I...” Remus was at a loss for words. “I don’t think anyone has ever cared about me like that.”, is what he finally concluded.            “Well, that’s their fault, then. They should. Because you are the most wonderful person I was ever allowed to meet.”, Sirius stated resolutely.Remus grabbed his cheeks and kissed him until neither of them was able to breathe. Sirius was absolutely fine with that.", "45541287999": ["Amaranthine - everlasting", "", "", "", "", "", "", "☽Regulus Black, 2013, Bordeaux, France☾", "", "", "", "", "Having hauled his suitcase up to get it checked, Regulus stepped forward, passing through the metal detector easily. Regulus was beyond excited to have finally gotten a seat on the plane— after days of trying several different options, he'd managed to secure one alongside his brother. For months he had been eagerly anticipating his trip to Tahiti. The idea of being surrounded by crystal clear waters and white sand beaches filled him with excitement. Now trailing after him, Sirius let out a loud sigh. They were going to be witnesses to the first cure for many diseases (including cancer) via genetic mutation. The idea of a cure for all ailments seemed almost too good to be true, however, they were sold on stories of its possibility. Of its existence. They were promised that science and technology would one day be able to provide the world with a solution for every illness, a cure, and though it seemed like an unattainable dream, they couldn't help but hold onto the hope that it was possible. They held onto the hope like every single traveller did— like every person in their rightful seats did. Seated next to him was a man with olive skin, a glowing beauty cast in the light of the sun peeking through the window, and glasses perched on the edge of his nose. James smiled warmly, like the sun in its beauty. His smile illuminated his face, warming up the space around him— It was as though a burst of sunshine had appeared on an otherwise gloomy day— full of charm and comfort, something Regulus gladly accepted with a twitch at the corners of his lips, hoping that was enough for the man who looked at Regulus.", "", "\"Hi,\" the man voiced \"I'm James. James Potter.\" James was a real sight for sore eyes— tall with dark, flowing hair and deep brown eyes. He had a kind smile that immediately drew people in— that immediately drew him in, and he couldn't help but be fascinated by James. James extended his hand to Regulus, then, who hesitantly took it, eyes narrowing in confusion, before shaking the hand firmly. \"Usually you introduce yourself, right about now. Kind of how it works.\" James teased with a small grin, causing Regulus to clear his throat.", "", "\"Right, sorry, I'm Regulus Black.\" He had yet to draw his hand back, but luckily he didn't have to, when James gave one final squeeze before pulling his own back. It was as if James' hand had burned him, yet it left all too soon— that soft touch, Regulus needed it, needed someone to touch him the way James had, not the cautious touches others left, mere brushes of skin for most knew Regulus didn't like physical contact most of the time.", "", "\"Like… Orion?\" James questioned, because Orion's name was literally on the side of the plane. He seemed so intrigued, and downright giddy, almost as if he was in awe of Orion's work— he shouldn't be. He shouldn't be looking up to a man who looked down on Regulus his entire life.", "", "\"Unfortunately,\" Regulus hummed out, jutting his chin out just to nod towards Sirius \"Sirius Black, my older brother. A nuisance, but a quick thinker. Being quick doesn't always mean being smart, but my parents seemed to think otherwise,\" he explained \"so, why are you on this flight?\" Regulus had never been able to help his own curiosity. He didn't usually like being the first one to ask, but he knew James probably wouldn't, since Regulus had already given his reason away without specifically saying it.", "", "\"I— my father, he's…\" James cleared his throat, shaking his head. \"Sick.\" He didn't go into detail of what he was sick with, but just that he was sick should be enough. \"A perfect, mystery cure is almost too good to be true, but it's my last hope. It's my only hope.\" James answered, a slight frown overtaking his features.", "", "\"I'm sorry,\" Regulus apologised. \"About your father, I mean.\"", "", "\"It's… well, I haven't lost hope,\" James spoke truthfully \"I can't.\"", "", "\"Then don't,\" Regulus voiced \"don't give up hope. No matter what, never give up hope. The moment you do, you're dead.\" Regulus spoke darkly with a heavy breath, mixing in with his voice.", "", "\"Wow, dark,\" James spoke on a heavy exhale, his hands balling up into fists, before he raised one, pressing it against his lips as he was deep in thought. \"Well then Mr. Hopeful, what do you think,\" James whispered \"about the miracle cure?\" He added to it, hoping it helped Regulus understand just what he meant.", "", "\"I think it brings hope to people who lost all of it, I think it brings a peace of mind to those with a usually stormy one.

Sirius realised, then, that his bag that was slung over his shoulder sat on half of the man's chair. \"Thank you,\" the man breathed out once Sirius pulled his bag aside, lowering himself down into the seat. \"I'm Remus.\"", "", "\"I'm Sirius.\" He responded in a soft whisper, yet loud enough to be heard by his seat-mate directly to his right.", "", "\"So am I,\" Remus confusedly frowned, to which Sirius loudly snorted, clapping his hand over his mouth to silence his laughter. \"What?\"", "", "\"No… my— my name, it's Sirius.\" Sirius showed the name tag on his bag, and Remus' eyes widened, then.", "", "\"Shit, sorry,\" Remus apologised \"I didn't—\"", "", "\"It's okay,\" Sirius quickly interrupted. \"It does sound rather strange, doesn't it?\" Sirius had always thought his name was stupid— that didn't mean he didn't like it, he loved his name, he just knew others thought it was stupid, and then so should he.", "", "Remus found himself huffing out, giving a playful roll of his eyes \"not really,\" he voiced \"you're named after a star.\" He noted, then.", "", "\"Strange family tradition.\" Sirius tried to explain with a scoff.", "", "\"That must make you a Black,\" Remus breathed out to which Sirius nodded. \"Oldest son of Orion and Walburga Black, lead scientists working on the E gene, otherwise known as the enhanced—\"", "", "\"Yes, yes, those.\" Sirius feels the warmth of the sun on his face as he sinks further back into his seat. \"How do you know so much? Are you with the press—\"", "", "\"Heh, no, I wish,\" Remus breathed out, interrupting Sirius \"ever since I was four years old, I've been… well, you know chronic pain, right? I'd go into the details, but that really isn't a fun conversation for a first meeting. Or a second— or any conversation.\" He added, and to that, Sirius hummed.", "", "\"So, you're willing to take a cure that has not been tested on humans, yet, because you think it'll fix you?\" Sirius was worried, eyes narrowing, eyebrows dipping deeply, a worried look stretching over his face. \"What if it only makes everything worse? It's genetic mutation— they're changing your DNA, Remus.\" Remus was overtaken by nerves when it came to thoughts of the cure; he wanted so badly for it to work, but he was equally terrified of what might happen if it didn't. Despite the risks involved, Remus knew that taking the cure was his only hope for a somewhat normal life, no amount of fear could hold him back from achieving his dream, from making this cure work.", "", "\"I don't think it'll fix me, but it might. It might help, it could make me feel better,\" Remus breathed out, eyes fixed on Sirius. Taking comfort in the moment, despite the knowledge of what awaited them all soon enough— what awaited him— Remus worried. He worried, yet he tried to relax, tried to think of the good outcome instead of the bad, but the bad always seemed to swim into the forefront of his mind. \"I have tried everything.\"", "", "\"Okay,\" Sirius responded, simply nodding. He hadn't wanted to upset the man, so he spoke calmly, hoping to make the man feel better. \"Okay.\"", "", "\"Sorry, I don't usually… I'm not usually this open— or quick to tell people things about my life,\" Remus tried to explain \"I just really need this to be true.

I’m a prankster, which will seem obnoxious to a lot of people, but it’s actually fun to mess with them… it might put a smile on someone's face, and that—that's all I can say about it— all I care about.\" Sirius explained in a soft tone, right before more people started filtering into the plane, taking their seats.", "", "Sirius could sleep anywhere— when you hear anywhere, don't think he can't, because he absolutely would sleep on top of a moving car if he had to. It took about an hour for him to fall asleep, head pressed against the window, laying in a slightly uncomfortable angle, Remus still wide-awake beside him, holding his notebook, scribbling down whatever he could, music softly playing into his ears, distracting him from the loud sounds of the plane, itself. Remus had been up all night, he was beyond exhausted and couldn't wait to get some of the sleep that he had clearly been missing out on. He curled up in his seat, hoping to try and relax before finally dozing off, but unfortunately it wasn't meant to last. Soon enough, the plane rocked, shaking awake most of its passengers. Then, moments later, the co-pilot's voice filtered through the speakers, explaining the situation, and that— oh, it was just Remus' luck. He hated planes, and to hear there was an unexpected change in the weather irritated him more than he could fathom.", "", "\"Hey,\" beside him, Sirius breathed out, having sensed Remus' fear. \"Hey, it's fine. It'll be fine, don't worry.\" His words weren't enough, so, as James had told him time and time again, be pushed past personal boundaries, grabbing onto Remus' hand, the man he barely knew, hoping to be comforting. It seemed to bring Remus at least a little bit of comfort in the midst of a storm. Remus didn't feel safe until it was announced that they were landing. He could finally breathe again, sigh escaping his bitten and bruised lips. \"Told you,\" Sirius smiled softly the moment the wheels hit the ground, slowly coming to a halt. \"Welcome to,\" Sirius gestured at the window with a cock of his eyebrow \"Tahiti.\" Sirius met Remus' gaze, his expression softening.", "", "", "", "☽Regulus Black☾", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "\"We are so grateful to be one of the first to experience— the first to get to see the miracle cure be dosed to humans.

It always went the same way, yet they never did get bored of it.", "", "\"Oh, but I am, my lady,\" Sirius bowed deeply, flicking a strand of hair away from her forehead \"Sirius Black at your service.\" Nymphadora chuckled as Sirius picked her in the side, but then her eyes travelled to Regulus, smile falling from her face as she looked at him. If there was one person Nymphadora was terrified of, it was Regulus Black.", "", "\"Hi,\" Nymphadora whispered, but the moment she did so, Regulus frowned. \"We should probably—\" she jutted her chin out, gesturing for them to follow Bellatrix who walked up front, now.", "", "\"Yeah,\" Regulus simply replied, hand wrapped around his wrist as he let his arms rest behind his back, the perfect picture of elegance Sirius never was. Regulus noticed how incredibly confused James was, then, seeing his eyebrows dip low, head slightly tilted, glasses askew as he tried to read Regulus. \"My niece.\"", "", "\"Ah, more family,\" James breathed out on a chuckle \"I have a feeling you have a big family.\"", "", "\"Ever the family man,\" Regulus responded jokingly, a huff escaping his lips \"sure… a big family.\"", "", "\"In you go,\" Bellatrix led everyone into the observation room. \"Good luck.\"", "", "", "", "☽Present time, Tahiti, after the outbreak☾", "", "", "", "", "Regulus was propped up against a wall, bag slung over his shoulder, gun resting in his hand as he let his eyelids fall shut if only for a second.", "", "\"So, what now?\" Nymphadora asked, using her dagger to carve her initials into the windowsill. \"Do we just… not go after them? Why did I have to stay with you, anyway?\"", "", "\"I don't know,\" Regulus strained out on a grunt, cracking his knuckles as he sat deep in thought. \"You aren't my choice of preferred company either.\"", "", "\"Preferred company,\" she mocked \"at least Sirius is fun.\"", "", "\"I'm not here to have fun, you're not here to have fun, we're here to survive, and if all you want to do is have fun, good luck, go out there, have fun. You'll be dead within the hour, I'll promise you that.\" Regulus looked up, making eye-contact with Nymphadora. He never really liked her— too loud, too opinionated, but she was a good kid. She was smart, just not in all fields. She wasn't smart enough to avoid getting on Regulus' nerves, that's for sure.", "", "\"Okay, alright, no need to be so fucking—\"", "", "\"Rude? No, I'm just stating facts. I'm here to keep you alive, I don't hesitate, I'm a hell of a good shot, so you're staying with me, because I will get the job done. I shoot first, ask questions later.\" He explained, and maybe that made him a bad person, but morality is not something he cared for in the midst of a war. Then, as Nymphadora scooted backwards, almost as if his words had burned her, he sighed. \"Are you hungry?\"", "", "\"What?\" Nymphadora looked up, eyebrows furrowing once more.", "", "\"Are you hungry?\" Regulus repeated a second time, more irritation in his voice as he did so.", "", "\"I heard you the first time, I'm just confused as to why you're offering me things all of a sudden.\"", "", "\"Then don't take the offer, I don't care.\" Regulus went right back to loading his gun, filling the magazine before slotting it back into the gun.", "", "\"What… what do you have?\" Nymphadora voiced, slowly coming closer to him.

I'm sure they'll be back soon.\"", "", "\"Are there monsters in here?\" Nymphadora asked, then, her curiosity taking control.", "", "\"If you count yourself,\" Regulus spoke, and Nymphadora scowled at that. It took a long pause, a tense silence before Regulus' voice filled it once more, gravelly and low \"no. No. There are no monsters in here.\"", "", "Nymphadora hummed as she popped a slice of pineapple into her mouth, humming around it. \"Are you ever… afraid of anything?\"", "", "\"You ask a lot of questions, you know that?\" Regulus cocked an eyebrow to which Nymphadora snorted.", "", "\"Yeah, because I asked them. Of course I know.\" Nymphadora answered dumbfoundedly.", "", "\"Not really,\" Regulus responded. \"What is fear, when that's all there is left? What is pain, when the world sees nothing else?

Trailing a little further behind was Remus, who, strangely, was almost entirely clean.", "", "\"Thank God,\" Nymphadora breathed out \"he's really depressing.\" She told her mother, and to that, Regulus rolled his eyes.", "", "\"She's really annoying.\" Regulus responded childishly, to which Sirius snorted.", "", "\"Piss off, you like me,\" Nymphadora pushed at his shoulder once she got close enough. \"He gave me pineapple.

With a grunt of effort, he began pushing against it, putting his legs into it, clenching his jaw tightly until the closet hit the ground with a crack, shaking the ground slightly. Without thinking, he stepped into the room, finding cabinets there, mostly empty, aside from one. The moment he climbed the counter to start grabbing things, his eyes narrowed. It didn't take long for him to find what they needed, but with slippery shoes— wet from the snow outside, Sirius hadn't thought about the risk, and as he fell backwards, all he could grab onto our of reflex was the door, which, yes, it was incredibly stupid. There was a loud crack, and before he knew it, the entire doorpost— and some of the wall crumbled apart, trapping him within the small room.", "", "\"Sirius!\" Came the familiar voice of Remus not too far away, on the other side of the rubble-wall. He heard things being shifted, but the more Remus tried to free him, the more rubble that came crashing down, rolling towards his feet.", "", "\"Stop! Remus, I need you to stop,\" Sirius breathed out \"this room is an unstable bomb and you're holding the trigger.\" He used a metaphor that Remus probably didn't understand as he didn't hear a reply. \"Don't touch anything or an overflow of rocks will crush me to death.\" Sirius explained, his voice trembling as he strained the words out. \"Don't move, don't even breathe too loudly.\"", "", "\"What do I do?\" Remus asked, and right then, they heard a low wail. It was followed by a mumbled \"shit\", and then the clicking of a gun. Oh shit, shit, shit, Remus was out there, alone, up against a fucking runner— or more than one, Sirius wasn't sure. All he could focus on was Remus' heavy breathing— then, followed by a gunshot was a loud hiss. Sirius turned around, then, eyes finding the small window. Sirius ripped open one of the drawers, finding a dagger in it, as well as kitchen supplies, but many of those he didn't need. First, he tossed out all the food, and water he could grab, then, pushing his forearms into the ground outside of the window, he grunted as the rocks scraped open his arms, but he wouldn't give up, not as he heard a loud crash— he knew he had to help, so he squirmed through that window as if his life depended on it, because in a way, it did. He only let himself collapse onto the ground momentarily, all the air pulled from his lungs, before he forcefully pushed himself up, rushing towards the front of the hut, pushing the door open. Rushing into the hole once more, he found Remus there, fighting what seemed to be four runners. Having been given the element of surprise, Sirius jumped onto the back of a runner, stabbing the dagger into its ear, watching its mouth fall open before collapsing to the ground. It almost seemed to be in slow-motion as Sirius stabbed another, whilst Remus shot the one that had held him pinned down. They seemed to work together almost perfectly, moving in sync, even their breaths puffing out at the same time as they fought. \"Out, we have to get out.\" Remus started pushing at Sirius' shoulder, and they could only breathe once they were outside.", "", "\"This yours?\" James' voice came from their left, and the moment Sirius looked up, he saw the things he had abandoned by the window in James' bag.", "", "\"I picked it up, yeah.\"", "", "", "", "☽☾", "", "", "", "Sirius inhaled sharply as Regulus hugged him back, arms slotting around his back, Sirius' cheek pressed against his temple. \"Pas de blessures?\"(No injuries?)

He hasn’t been out alone in a club with the intention of having a quick and filthy fuck in the club bathroom in a while. He can feel the alcohol warming him from the inside as his skin starts buzzing with anticipation. He turns his back to the bar, leans back on his elbows with a stance that says, “look at me, don’t you want to fuck me?” and starts examining the scene in front of him. He is in one of his favourite gay clubs in the city. It's crowded; men grinding up on each other under the disguise of dancing, others waiting on the sidelines watching, enjoying, chatting. It feels as if the music is pumping through his blood the way he can feel the vibrations all over. He can't wait to join the crowd of sweaty, some shirtless, all dancing men; he just needs to find someone he'll want to do unspeakable things to. He smiles as his gaze flickers from person to person, and then he sees him. His wavy black hair sticking to his forehead with sweat, his mouth slightly open, his head thrown back against some guy’s shoulder, his shiny, slightly baggy grey satin shirt left mostly unbuttoned and tucked into the black trousers that fit snuggly on his hips but continue straight down his legs seemingly leaving him enough room to move as seductively and gracefully as he's currently moving. The silver pendant left on display on his chest catches James's eyes as it occasionally reflects the club's moving lights. James can swear he knows him, the way he feels drawn to this beautiful creature. He finally lifts his gaze from the bare glistening chest adorned with one silver necklace to his face again and finds himself looking right into familiar grey eyes. James sees the recognition dawn on Regulus's face, and he's almost certain the same expression is reflected back to him. He doesn't know what to do, so he just keeps staring. Just a second before, he was certain he'd found the guy he was going to fuck senseless in the bathroom, but now he wasn't so sure. He watches as Regulus puts his hands on top of the hands resting on either side of his hips and raises them as he turns his back to James, leaving James disappointed with the fact that he's going to be ignored. At least he gets to see truly how well those slacks fit his arse. He decides he should look away and find someone more appropriate than his best friend's younger brother to lust after, but before he can tear his eyes away from Regulus's truly magnificent arse, he sees him turn around and start walking toward him. For a second, James panics, but then he tries to remind himself that it's just Regulus. “Yeah, it’s just Regulus who looks absolutely delectable and made James half-hard by simply dancing,” his brain supplies unhelpfully. Regulus is finally in front of him, and James struggles to find something, anything to say, but it seems he doesn't have to worry. Regulus puts one of his hands on the bar next to James's elbow and leans in, \"Hello, Potter,\" Regulus says; his face is so close to James's that he's pretty sure he can feel Regulus's breath on his skin. He tries not to shiver at that thought. James rolls his eyes at Regulus’s insistence on calling him by his last name, “Hello, Reg,” he says as he takes his elbow off the bar to turn towards Regulus. They are both leaning on their sides to the bar and looking into each other’s eyes. “What a nice surprise,” James adds. Regulus cocks a brow, “Is it?” \"Absolutely,\" James flashes him a grin, and Regulus rolls his eyes playfully. \"I don't see my annoying brother anywhere. He usually can't stay away from you for this long, so… I take it you're alone?\" He has an inscrutable look on his face. James simply nods in response. Regulus smirks, \"You're here to pull then? Oh, you dirty boy!\" he swats James jokingly. \"Well, I don't see your friends either,\" James responds, smiling; it's technically not a question, but Regulus hears the question in it anyways. “Guilty,” he smirks, and James thinks fuck, he’s hot, and not for the first time. “Let me buy you a drink?” James offers. “Sure, I’ll take a shot as long as you’re having one with me.” James orders them two shots of Regulus's preferred brand of whiskey after he scrunches up his nose in distaste at James's suggestion of doing tequila shots. While he immediately knocks his shot down, he notices Regulus drinks it more carefully. “God, they shouldn’t serve whiskey in shots, it’s blasphemous,” he says pointedly. \"You asked for it,\" James objects, laughing. “I know, but still…” he leaves his sentence unfinished. They look at each other in silence then, and James can't help but let his gaze linger as he looks Regulus up and down. When he returns his gaze to Regulus's, he can tell Regulus knew he was being checked out. Well, he wasn't really subtle about it. \"You look good,\" words tumble out of James's mouth without even realizing it. Regulus seems surprised for a second before the cocky smirk returns to his face, \"You look good too, Potter.\" His voice feels like velvet, James wants to hear him make all sorts of noises. His attention is drawn back to what he's wearing when he feels Regulus's slender fingers on the cuff of his sleeve. The rings on Regulus's fingers brush against his shoulder, and James suddenly has the urge to press against them to make sure they leave a mark. Regulus is still holding the sleeve James cuffed all the way up to his shoulders to ensure his arms were on full display tonight. He's wearing his favourite white The Clash t-shirt that's slightly short on him causing it to expose some skin that has a design of the London Calling album cover. He knows it looks good on him because Sirius has tried to steal it multiple times, saying he deserves that “sexy piece of cloth” and that it's more his style because it's “slutty and punk,” and James kindly told him to fuck off. Regulus’s hand drops from the sleeve to the hem of the shirt, his knuckles almost grazing James’s skin. James feels his breath quicken with the idea of having Regulus’s fingers on his skin. “Never really seen you wear something like this,” Regulus tells him, his gaze lighting James’s skin on fire. \"I mean, you're one to talk, I'm in just jeans and a t-shirt.\" Regulus doesn't let go of James's shirt as his eyes finally find James's. He cocks his head slightly to the side, \"What's wrong with what I'm wearing?\" Is he being intentionally seductive, or is it just James being horny? James can't tell. \"Oh, absolutely fucking nothing is wrong with what you're wearing, Reg, quite the opposite actually. Well, same as you, I guess. I've just never seen you wear something like this.\" Regulus looks down at his clothes as he keeps holding onto James's shirt. He raises his head back up and gives James a small but mischievous smile, \"This is actually quite casual for a night out.\" “Of course, it is,” James mumbles to himself. \"What's that?\" Regulus cocks an arrogant brow at James, and James decides he's had enough of Regulus's little game of seduction. Two can play that game. So, he tucks a finger inside Regulus’s shirt and finds out that it’s as soft as it looks. He rests his finger above the only button that’s still buttoned up. \"Don't you think this is a bit indecent? I mean, how many buttons is that, three, four?\" James shoots him a playful smile to let him know this is by no means a snipe. \"Are you complaining?\" Regulus feels closer than he did minutes ago, did one of them take a step forward? James can't recall. \"No… I'm really not.\" He feels Regulus's knee brush against the inside of his leg, and James's cock immediately responds to the feeling. Jesus, he hasn't felt this keyed up in so long; he doesn't understand what's got in him. Sure, he always thought Regulus was beautiful. How can he not? He has eyes, after all, but he doesn't remember ever feeling this drawn to him. He wants to… he wants— “Aren’t you gonna ask me to dance?\" Regulus asks as he takes his hand off the bar, turns his back to the dancefloor completely, still holding onto James's shirt, and gives him a seductive smile. God, was he always like this? How had James never noticed Regulus's insane magnetism? Maybe this was the first time Regulus tried to lure James in. James pushes himself off the bar, his finger still tucked inside Regulus's shirt, and takes a step towards Regulus as Regulus takes a step back. \"Regulus, will you dance with me?\" James asks with all the charm he knows he possesses. Regulus smiles at him; this one seems less calculated, a genuine reaction rather than a device to pull James in. He nods, and his gentle hold on James's shirt turns into a fist as he pulls James in. They join everyone else on the dancefloor. As soon as they step into the crowd, Regulus pulls James against him. He lets go of James's shirt but lets his fingers linger on the exposed skin between the shirt and jeans. James wants to pull Regulus completely to himself, to feel him and to let him feel with the way Regulus's gentle whisper of a touch feels on his skin. They start swaying to the rhythm. Regulus rests one of his hands on James's hip, tucking his finger into one of the belt loops, and pulls James closer. James throws his arms on Regulus's shoulders, crossing his hands behind Regulus's head. Regulus's other hand finds its way to the small of James' back. He presses his hand, fingers splayed open to James's skin. James can't remember ever having such an erotic experience with someone, especially in a club. James is taller than Regulus, so Regulus is almost the perfect height to tuck his face into James's neck. He doesn't do anything except rest his forehead against James's shoulder for a couple of seconds before slowly throwing it back, shaking it so he can get the hair out of his face. James brings a hand back to Regulus’s face to help him out, gently tucking Regulus’s hair away from his face. Then suddenly, Regulus moves in a way that causes James to grind his hard cock into his hip bone. James lets out an involuntary moan that is easily suppressed by the loud music. James doesn't know if the first one was intentional, but he's pretty sure the second grind of Regulus's hips against his erection is intentional. Regulus smirks up at him and continues his grinding. James moves his hand from Regulus's cheek to the back of his head, running his hand through Regulus's hair, and then he finally grips a handful. He lowers his head so his mouth is right next to Regulus's ear before he speaks. \"Can I kiss you?\" he's breathless as he asks because Regulus hasn't stopped his grinding. Regulus pulls his head back, coming face to face with James, and nods. James smiles as he pulls Regulus in for a kiss. He starts out slow, tasting, savouring, burning the taste of Regulus's lips into his mind, but it doesn't take long before Regulus's kiss becomes more demanding. He sucks on James's lower lip and grazes his teeth, not yet biting but teasing. James tugs on Regulus's hair to pull his head back so he can use his height advantage and devour him like he wants to. Regulus's mouth falls open when James tugs on his hair, and James brings his other hand to Regulus's jaw, gently grabbing and holding him in place as he slowly explores Regulus's mouth with his tongue. The kiss has turned absolutely filthy with the way they're still grinding against each other albeit with no consistent rhythm, with the way he can feel the half-crescent moons forming under the pressure of Regulus’s nails on his skin, but James still manages to slowly massage his tongue against Regulus’s. He slowly licks Regulus’s lower lip. \"Jesus, fuck,\" Regulus moans out, James can't really hear the words, but he feels their shapes. James lets his hand drop from Regulus's jaw to his throat, dragging his fingers. He rests it there for a few seconds as Regulus impatiently pushes his tongue against James's. Then he slowly drags them down to Regulus's sternum and curls his fingers against his bare chest, letting his fingernails graze the skin. Regulus moans into his mouth, losing his focus for a second before he continues kissing James. James thinks they probably look obscene, as if they're shooting a soft-core porno, but he also thinks they're probably not the only ones. His traitorous brain suddenly reminds him that he's currently tongue deep in his best friend's brother, but he doesn't want to stop; he doesn't think he can stop, so he pushes all thoughts of Sirius away and focuses on the beautiful man under his hands. He moves his thigh between Regulus's leg and moves the hand on Regulus's sternum to the side to gently play with his nipple. He drops his hand from Regulus's hair to his arse, grabbing a handful before guiding Regulus's crotch to his thigh. Regulus lets his head fall back, his mouth open; James's pretty sure he's moaning, and he wants to taste it. He is guiding Regulus to basically ride his thigh with the hand on his arse, and because both of his hands are occupied, he bites Regulus's chin gently to draw his attention back. Regulus's eyes are glassy with pleasure when he finally looks back into James's eyes. He seems lost for a second before he comes back, his eyes burning with determination, and he brings his hands up to James's chest and pushes him lightly. James is terrified for a second that he's crossed some kind of line as he stumbles a step back and lets go of Regulus carefully. As James opens his mouth to apologize, Regulus shakes his head no, grabs James's hand, and starts dragging him through the crowd. After a couple of seconds, James realizes Regulus is going in the direction of the bathrooms and relaxes, finally getting an idea of what's about to happen. When they finally reach the bathrooms, James notices it's quiet enough to converse, so he asks just to make sure, \"Is everything okay? I didn't do something—\" Regulus turns around and interrupts him, \"You didn't do anything wrong. I just need to…\" he seems frustrated, realizing both of the bathrooms are occupied, and James thinks that might be the cause of the frustration. James pulls Regulus to himself, wrapping one arm around his waist. \"Hey, it's okay,\" he says softly and kisses Regulus just as softly. They both hear the sound of a door opening and snap their heads toward it. Two guys stumble out, looking ruffled. James can't really judge, seeing as he's about to do the same thing. Regulus gets out of James's grasp and pulls him towards to recently emptied bathroom. As soon as they get in, Regulus pushes James against the door and starts kissing him fiercely while his hand goes to the lock, and after some trying, he locks the door without breaking their kiss. James's hands fly to Regulus's shirt; he unbuttons it and gets it out of his slacks so he can wrap both his arms fully around Regulus under his shirt. Regulus quietly moans into his mouth when he feels James envelop and pull him to his chest. Regulus's hands find their way into James's hair; he doesn't tug, he just holds onto them. One of James's hands drops to Regulus's arse; James curls his fingers slightly to grab onto it and pulls Regulus's crotch onto his own. He moans at the contact, feeling the pressure against his cock. He starts grinding up against him as they did on the dancefloor. Regulus drops one hand to James's chest and slowly starts dragging it down until he reaches James's jeans. He pushes James back to stop his grinding and create some space so he can palm him through his jeans, so it seems. James breaks the kiss throwing his head back, groaning. He hits his head slightly, but no feeling can distract him from feeling Regulus's hand on his cock. “Reg…” he pants out. “Hm?” He tries to find something to say in response, but it's like his mind is short-circuiting every five seconds. “Potter?” Regulus asks again. He sounds just as breathless as James feels. “God, I can’t think…” Regulus stops moving his hand, puts a hand on James's chest, and takes a step back; James barely holds back the whine of protest in his throat. \"Can you think now?\" James can feel Regulus smirking, so he brings his gaze back down to him, which turns out to be a terrible idea because compared to the dancefloor the bathroom is quite well-lit meaning he can see how well-fucked Regulus seems even though they haven't got to that part yet. His hair is messed up from James's hands, his lips kiss-swollen and blood red, his shirt completely unbuttoned, barely hanging on his shoulders. James wants him like he'll die if he doesn't get to touch him, and he can't remember the last time attraction felt like this. “Jesus,” he pants out in both arousal and frustration. “Regulus is fine, thank you,” Regulus smirks again and James rolls his eyes. “You’re terrible,” he tells Regulus possibly grinning. “Hm, sure I am. Tell me?” “Um, what?” \"What do you want?\" Regulus rolls his eyes, seeming kind of fond. “Oh… I don’t—” James stops talking and remembers how he wanted to hear Regulus make all sorts of noises and how he really wants to watch him as he comes. “I wanna make you come,” he tells Regulus trying to tamp down his excitement at the prospect of touching Regulus. “Figures,” he rolls his eyes again. “What?” James asks, actually curious. “Figures you’d be the pleasing kind,” Regulus explains with a small smile. \"Is that so bad?\" James asks tilting his head to the side, giving Regulus his most charming smile. Regulus rolls his eyes again, but James can see him struggling to hold back a smile. \"How can I make you come?\" he asks; even though he wants to know every possible way to make Regulus come, one would be enough for now. Regulus cocks a brow in question. \"I just meant, like, um, what works best for you? Everyone's different, so I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable,\" he forces out as an explanation. \"Dysphoric, you mean?\" James feels kind of ashamed after Regulus's question; he hopes it wasn't like an incredibly stupid move. “Um, yeah, is that okay to ask?” \"Well, since you're going to make me come, it's kind of necessary, I guess,\" he shrugs, and James feels another surge of arousal at the way Regulus said you’re going to make me come. \"I've had a lot of casual sex, so I'm usually quite comfortable unless the other person says something… um, sketchy?\" Regulus explains. “Sketchy?” \"Like I don't like it when someone refers to it by gendered terms like… I'm sure you know.\" James nodded in response. \"Other than that, just don't call me a girl or something like that; we're fine.\" James cringes, “Jesus, do people do that?” \"Eh, it's like a kink or fetish people have.\" James makes a face in response again, and Regulus chuckles softly. “I won’t obviously call you anything like that,” James reassures him. “I know,” Regulus nods. James gets off the door and steps towards Regulus, wanting to get back to the fire they created moments ago. “How do you feel about being called beautiful, pretty, sweet?” James’s voice naturally deepens when his words are coated in his lust. Regulus raises his brows in amusement, \"Sweet? Seriously, Potter? Sweet?\" James nods as he takes another step toward Regulus, causing Regulus to step back and find himself pressed against the wall. \"They're fine,\" Regulus mumbles, his eyes on James's lips, waiting for him to close the distance. James brings his lips to Regulus's cheek, not kissing him but dragging them toward Regulus's ear. James feels Regulus shiver in response; considering it's hot as balls, James thinks it's because of him. \"I think you're very sweet, Regulus. I bet you taste sweet, too,\" a whine escapes Regulus's throat. \"Oh, I'd love to get my mouth on you,\" he keeps whispering in Regulus's ear as he drags his hand across his chest, playing with his nipples for a beat before continuing, burning every sound Regulus makes into his memory. He finally reaches Regulus's trousers; they're beautiful and high quality, definitely tailored considering how well they fit. James slowly rests his hand on Regulus's crotch; he basically grabs him. He thinks Regulus would like that considering how he responded to being grabbed by the jaw. And he finds out he is right when Regulus awards him with a breathy moan. \"Jesus,\" Regulus mumbles, what almost sounds like disbelief. \"Just James is fine,\" James tells him, smirking as he puts some pressure on the area that's most likely to give Regulus pleasure. \"Fuck off,\" Regulus huffs out as he grinds back on James's hand, his breath picking up pace. James smiles against his jaw and then starts kissing his way down to Regulus's neck. He sucks on the parts that get the most response out of Regulus. \"Oh my god,\" Regulus says louder than the ones that came before. James feels delirious with the excitement of making Regulus feel good. He licks a stripe up to Regulus's ear and gently holds his earlobe between his teeth. Regulus exhales loudly at the gesture. James continues playing with Regulus's earlobe with the tip of his tongue and teeth, drawing out breathy moans from Regulus. He finally lets go so he can ask, \"Can I touch you?\" he puts just a tad bit more pressure on where Regulus's grinding against his hand as he talks. “Yeah, please,” is all Regulus gets out. James chuckles quietly as he undoes Regulus’s trousers and pushes his hand in. He feels Regulus first over his boxers and when he feels the wet cloth, he groans as Regulus lets out another breathy moan. He almost loses his mind when he feels Regulus’s hard little cock. He starts using his fingers to basically jerk him off.   “Fuck, you feel so good,\" James murmurs against Regulus's skin. Regulus's head is thrown back against the wall exposing his beautiful throat; James feels like he has no choice but to latch onto it. Regulus groans loudly at the contact. \"Beautiful,\" James murmurs and grazes his teeth on Regulus's throat. \"Fuck, fuck, James,\" Regulus's hand finds James's and pulls it off. Before James can panic, he pushes James's hand inside his boxers and help position James's fingers the way he wants them. He guides it up and down several times before letting James continue on his own. \"Fuck, kiss me, Jam—\" James latches onto Regulus's lips before he can finish his sentence. He keeps touching Regulus just the way he had shown and mindlessly grinds his erection against Regulus's leg. He’s not trying to get himself off, but his dick seems to have a mind of his own. Regulus stops kissing James, well, more accurately his mouth falls open and he seems far too gone to kiss James back. James pulls back a little to watch Regulus. \"Gorgeous,\" Regulus's eyes open slightly at James's compliment, but fall shut again as James picks his pace up just slightly. \"Yes, yeah, God,\" words seem to tumble out of Regulus's mouth without a thought, and James is pretty sure he has never seen anything this beautiful.\"More,\" Regulus says, and James isn't sure what he means. More pressure? Faster? He tries increasing the pressure slightly to test it, and he's awarded the loudest moan of the night, so much so that Regulus's hand flies up to his mouth to muffle it. James wants to protest, but even this sight, Regulus struggling to keep quiet biting down on his hand, is so beautiful and deserves to be remembered forever, so he lets it. Suddenly there is a loud knock on the door, James stops for a second in panic, but Regulus makes a noise in protest, almost like a cry, so James thinks fuck it, and he continues where he left off as he yells back, \"Occupied.\" He is pretty sure he hears some grumbling, but everyone can go fuck themselves; he needs to make this beautiful boy come. It's not long before Regulus returns to how he was before they got interrupted. He's whining and trashing, trying his best to get there. It seems like he needs something else like a push so James does what he does best and starts talking. \"God, Reg, I have never seen something like you. I wanna make you come so bad, baby.\" Okay, the baby kind of slipped out, but it's fine; it's sex, it's fine. \"I need to see you come, you're so fucking beautiful like this. I can't imagine how beautiful you'll be when you come. I need to see it. Fuck, I want to do everything to you, I wanna suck you, fuck you—\" Regulus whines at the suggestions, and James smiles to himself. \"Yeah? You'd like that? We can do that, baby, just come for me, let me see, God, Reg, I wanna see it. I wanna make you come in every way possible, again and again, until you can't take it anymore. Will you let me?\" Regulus nods as he tries to muffle the noises he's making with his hand. \"I love the way you sound. I wanna hear every noise you make, fuck, I'm so hard. I don't think I've ever been this hard,\" James chuckles to himself. \"I've been hard since I've seen you dancing with that guy. You looked ethereal. Before I realised you were you, I thought oh, I need to fuck him, and then when I realized it was you, god, I think I wanted it more.\" Regulus whimpers in response. James can see how close and how frustrated he is. \"You're so good, Reg, you're doing so good. I bet you'd look divine on your knees for me, you'd be so sweet with my cock in your mouth—\" before James can finish that particular train of thought, Regulus's eyes roll back as he arches off the wall and starts shaking as his orgasm rakes through him. James was right Regulus is absolutely fucking beautiful when he comes. Regulus eventually calms down, and he gently pushes James's hand. He's leaning on James as he tries to get his wits back. His hands find James's arms and hold onto him. He looks spent, and so, so sweet. James wants to kiss him, so he does, on his temple. “Jesus, Potter,” he breathes out almost like a laugh. “I told you it’d J—” \"Shut the fuck up,\" Regulus interrupts annoyed, and James laughs. \"Give me a second, and I'll get you back,\" Regulus mumbles. “What? Oh, that’s not—” they’re once again interrupted by loud knocking. “Come the fuck on!” Someone yells from the other side. “We should get out,” James sighs. “Fuck ‘em, let me make you come,” he says in a suggestive murmur. \"It's fine, Reg, I promise. You've given me spank bank material for, like, at least fifty years.\" Regulus scrunches up his nose in disgust, “Spank bank? Really, Potter? How are you both insanely hot and an annoying dork?” \"You think I'm insanely hot?\" James raises a cocky eyebrow at Regulus as he buttons two of Regulus's buttons. Regulus handles the rest and turns to the mirror to fix his hair. “Fucking hell, what did you do to my neck? I look like I’ve been mauled by an animal,” Regulus says in distress as he buttons up most of his shirt, but James can tell he’s not actually that bothered. James stands behind him in the mirror. They look really good together. \"Eh, it's fine. You usually don't show this much skin anyways,\" Regulus's eyes find his in the mirror and send him a sharp look with no real heat behind it. \"God, we're not fucking teenagers. It's embarrassing,\" Regulus mutters mostly to himself. “Well, you weren’t complaining then, quite the opposite actually.” \"Well,\" he says pointedly, \"I was in throws of passion, you see, clouded by the ecstasy of getting off.\" \"I was there too, so you can't blame me either,\" James insists. Regulus rolls his eyes and finally seems satisfied with the way he looks. He turns around and as soon as his eyes land on James he throws his head back and groans in frustration. James laughs, “What’s wrong?” “You look well-fucked and you’re still half-hard,” he brings his gaze back to James’s. “I feel well-fucked even though—” Loud knocking interrupts them once again. “We should stay here out of spite,” Regulus offers, but James grabs his hand and drags him out laughing. When they get out, the guy—the drag queen who has been waiting gives them the nastiest look ever. “I fucking hate the gays,” she says to no one in particular but is definitely directed to them as she walks in. They're both quiet for a second before they burst out laughing. They’re walking to the door when some guy stops Regulus. “Ah, finally found you,” he says smiling sweetly at Regulus. James sees Regulus smile back and wonders who this guy is. He remembers Regulus saying he came here alone. “How about another dance?” he hears the guy saying—shouting at Regulus over the loud music. He doesn’t like this guy even though he has done nothing wrong—yet. \"Uh, I'm leaving actually, sorry,\" Regulus grabs James's hand, and James feels the annoyance that's been brewing since they've been stopped simmering down. The guy gives James an appraising look before turning back to Regulus and James has the sudden urge to punch something or someone. He says something else Regulus, but James can’t catch it and he gives something to Regulus as well before turning around and leaving. James stays staring at his back until Regulus starts dragging him by the hand. The fresh air hits James like a punch when they're finally outside the club. \"I think that place had no oxygen left in it,\" Regulus says, sounding annoyed, but that's just how he always sounds. \"Who was that guy?\" James asks out of nowhere. Regulus turns to him and gives him a funny look. He realizes he looks like a jerk demanding answers from the guy he hooked up with once. \"I just meant, um, he seemed kinda pushy,” James tries to save face. \"He was fine,\" he rolls his eyes, and James wants to kiss him. Oh, that's dangerous; getting attached is very dangerous. Regulus hasn't given James any indication of this night being more than a one-night stand. \"I was dancing with him before I came over to you,\" Regulus clarifies casually. \"Oh.\" James realizes Regulus has started walking and catches up to him with a couple big steps. \"What did he say?\" he tries his best to sound casual as if he's just making conversation. “When?” \"Like just before he left,\" James is trying his damnedest to sound indifferent. However, he had no idea as to if it was working. “Oh, that. It’s nothing,” Regulus shrugs it off. “Was it about me?” Regulus turns his head to him, laughing, \"You're so fucking self-obsessed, you know?\" James just nods, \"I know, but like logically, why else wouldn't you tell me?\" he grins. \"You're insufferable,\" Regulus sighs, but James can tell he's not actually annoyed. “Well, you weren’t saying that when I was—” \"He said if you weren't up to my standards, I should give him a call,\" he interrupts James and holds out a napkin with a number on it, \"hence, this,\" he points to the napkin with his head. After his demonstration he crumbles the napkin in his hand, looks around as if to search for a bin. There isn’t one nearby. James sees Regulus put the napkin back in his pocket. James tries his best to not react in any noticeable way and makes sure his voice sounds casual before he starts speaking, \"I guess the joke's on him.\" Regulus cocks a brow in question. \"Since I had already made you come so hard, you saw stars by the time he offered his services,\" James says with all the confidence he possesses. People meaning his friends, give him shit for being cocky all the time, but he knows his confidence is one of the most attractive things about him. Regulus stops in his tracks, holding out his arm to also stop James. James turns to find a shocked Regulus. \"God, Potter, you're so full of yourself, aren't you?\" he asks in disbelief. James steps toward him, and thankfully Regulus doesn't step back. When they're so close that they're almost touching each other, he stops, gently grabs Regulus's chin between his thumb and pointer finger, and tilts his head back, so they're face to face. \"Shouldn't I be?\" he asks, his voice coming out deep and suggestive. Regulus rolls his eyes. \"Oh, so you didn't enjoy yourself?\" James asks in a mocking tone, and Regulus's gaze suddenly turns intense. “I didn’t say that,” Regulus answers quietly but still stern. \"Was I wrong?\" when Regulus looks at him in confusion, he clarifies, \"Was I wrong when I said I made come so hard that you saw stars?\" He sees, hears, and feels Regulus’s breath catch. “No,” he mutters long seconds later. James moves his hand from Regulus’s chin to his cheek and just looks at Regulus’s face. “God, you’re pretty,” James whispers without meaning to but forgets all about regretting when he catches Regulus's gaze soften for a moment. He turns his lips to James's palm and grazes his teeth at the skin there. James feels his cock jerk up in response. Jesus, what kind of power did Regulus have over James's cock? “So, you’ve said,” Regulus says when he turns his head back. James chuckles. \"So, I've said,\" he repeats. It seems James can't tear his eyes away from Regulus's lips. They'd kissed and done much more than kissing tonight;however, this feels different. He isn't sure if he is allowed. \"Fuck it,\" he murmurs to himself before continuing. “Can I kiss you?” Regulus’s eyes widen in surprise for a second before he nods and mumbles out a “yeah.” James brings his other hand to the other side of Regulus's face and closes the distance between them. He kisses Regulus slowly. It's not meant to reignite the fire they had felt tonight, it's meant to say good night, and I hope we kiss again. Regulus also seems to understand this, not trying to turn the kiss into something fiercer. James feels Regulus's hands hold onto either side of his t-shirt, scrunching up the material into his fists. James can't help but deepen the kiss after feeling Regulus trying to hold onto him as if he wants to tether himself to this moment. It's still slow, and it still says good night, but now, he is also stroking his tongue against Regulus's gently. James doesn’t know how long they kiss on that sidewalk. It feels like forever and not enough at the same time.", "45541108000": "Полный состав их братства собирается далеко не каждый год. Когда Вэй Ин задумывается об этом, то вспоминает, как об этом однажды сказал сам господин Смерть:\n— Это место находится вне времени, Усянь.\nСмерть улыбается, и, хотя Вэй Ин уже пьян, он снова тянется за кувшином вина. Эту жуткую улыбку хочется заглушить шумом в голове от алкоголя, но ещё ни разу у него не получилось.\nИ это странно, ведь, честно говоря, пугать господину Смерть нечем. Внешность у него самая обычная, одежда, конечно, странная, но у того же Шэнь Вэя ничуть ни лучше. Но всё равно от его взгляда хочется бежать без оглядки и никогда не возвращаться.\n— Далеко не всё мне подвластно, — продолжает Смерть дружелюбно. — Да, одна ночь в году, но какой именно год из твоей жизни… Для сделки это неважно.\nОн смеётся — и этот звук, словно скрежет когтей по мечу, словно вой призрака в ночной тишине.\n— Обещаю одно одолжение, если отгадаешь принцип, — добавляет Смерть. — Это будет забавно.\nВэй Ин чувствует, что на его собственном лице улыбка неестественно замирает, искривляясь в совсем другую гримасу, и вливает в себя половину кувшина. Только бы не думать об этой интонации, об этих глазах.\nБольшую часть года он не помнит, и это — благословение. Но сегодня ночью он не может позволить себе такую роскошь. В этот раз стол полон гостей, здесь собрались все. Вэй Ин натягивает на лицо выражение радостного идиота и отпускает поводья разума. Иначе просто не выдержит эту ночь.\n— Заткнись, Вэй Усянь! — рявкают хором Ло Бинхэ с Шэнь Фэйсяо, и Вэй Ин смеётся от их синхронности. Мысленно он надеется, что смех не перейдёт в истерический.\n— О, однажды меня хотели заткнуть настолько сильно, что сбросили со скалы! — громогласно заявляет он и в очередной раз прикладывается к вину, находя в нём спасение. От этого места, этих людей, этой ночи.\nЗа столом воцаряется неожиданное молчание. Вэй Ин понимает, что, кажется, сказал лишнего, но \"Улыбка\" уже слегка туманит разум.\n— Ты про который из двух?\nЭтот вопрос, заданный тихим и спокойным голосом из дальнего угла, заставляет его подавиться. Господин Смерть даже не улыбается, а смотрит как-то понимающе, и от этого ещё хуже.\n— Тот, когда мы заключили сделку, — говорит Смерть и отстранённо смотрит куда-то вдаль.\n— Да, — подтверждает Вэй Ин, потому что этому существу нельзя не ответить.\n— Вообще-то, ты не один такой, — Смерть усмехается, и кажется — его неожиданно обдало морозом. — В этой компании удивительно много паданцев, да?\nСмерть поочерёдно смотрит на Шэнь Вэя, Ло Бинхэ и Хэ Сюаня.\n— Никуда я не падал! — огрызается последний. — Мне хватило неприятностей и без этого!\n— Мета… Метафорически, братец Хэ, ты свалился ещё глубже, чем я, — произносит Вэй Ин, не думая.\nОн не сразу вспоминает, что вообще значит это слово, и где он его слышал.\nВ оглушающей тишине Вэй Ин слышит смех юного мальчишки. Он поднимает взгляд и вместе со всеми ошарашенно глядит на господина Смерть, который как никогда похож на обычного человека. Впервые за всё время Вэй Ин замечает, как же тот молод. Ещё младше, чем был он сам, когда встал на Тёмный путь.\n— О Мерлин, как ты вообще это помнишь, — произносит он сквозь смех, и изумрудные глаза пылают весельем.\nВэй Ин и не помнил — до этого момента. Но сейчас он знает, откуда это слово взялось. Ту ночь он провёл наедине с господином Смерть, больше за столом не было никого. Это был… Первый год? Ещё до того, как он всё же умер. Вэй Ин пил, пил и пил, лишь бы не глядеть в лицо существа, сидящего напротив.\nКак же ему тогда было страшно.\n— Чулан под лестницей, — бормочет Вэй Ин, цепляясь за смутное воспоминание.\n— О, — господин Смерть даже слегка удивлён. — Да, чулан…\nОн вздыхает, и Вэй Ин снова поражается его сегодняшней человечности. Если бы господин Смерть мог быть таким всегда, было бы замечательно. Или…\n— Когда-то давно я жил в чулане под лестницей. Там было много пауков…\nСмерть подтягивает колени к груди и обхватывает их руками. В этот момент он куда больше похож на растерянного подростка, чем на всемогущую сущность.\n— Ты был человеком? — мрачно произносит Шэнь Фэйсяо, и вся уязвимость мгновенно слетает с господина Смерть, словно кожура со спелого плода.\n— Очень давно, Фэйсяо, — господин Смерть чеканит это так, что никому больше не хочется задавать вопросы. Никому, кроме, конечно, Вэй Инп.\n— А что это, господин Смерть? — уточняет он шутливо, снова разрывая вязкую тишину. Вэй Ин, как и всегда, отпугивает ужас тем, что бежит впереди него, предугадывая события. Лучшего способа он не придумал за две жизни.\n— Чулан? — уточняет Смерть и задумчиво прищуривается за круглыми стёклами очков. — Маленькая комнатка для барахла. Слишком маленькая даже для одиннадцатилетнего мальчишки…\nВэй Ину снова страшно, но после того, что он увидел недавно, в его восприятии господина Смерти словно что-то сдвигается. Страх больше не застилает глаза так уж сильно.\nОн зачем-то пытается это себе представить. Маленькая комнатка… Всё же лучше, чем спать на земле и кутаться в старую одежду, почти не защищающую от холода.\n— Лучше, Усянь, — соглашается господин Смерть, встречаясь с ним взглядом. — В чём-то это и правда лучше.\nНаверное, впервые за всё время, что Вэй Ин бывает здесь, он видит, как господин Смерть тянется к вину и отпивает пару глотков. Тот обводит взглядом всех собравшихся за столом и произносит тихо и сочувственно, но всё равно — пугающе:\n— Лучше, чем жить на улице и питаться объедками, лучше, чем едва спастись от собак, лучше, чем терпеть побои, лучше, чем голодать и едва не умереть от холода.\nОбраз господина Смерти в голове Вэй Ина странно задваивается, накладываясь один другой. Молодой парень, обычный и похожий на него самого, и высшая сущность, пугающая одним фактом своего существования. Ни один из них сейчас не перевешивает, и это сбивает с толку.\n— Это тебе не грёбаный конкурс, — злобно произносит Ло Бинхэ. — Нечего выискивать главного страдальца!\n— Бинхэ, а ты уже вылез из бездны? — господин Смерть спрашивает почти ласково, но от звуков его голоса Вэй Ин трезвеет. Ярко-зелёные глаза мерцают алыми всполохами. — Нашёл своего шизуна?\n— Ты! — Бинхэ вскакивает, но больше ничего не говорит, лишь сверлит господина Смерть глазами.\n— Спокойно, братец Ло. Впереди ещё половина ночи, — вворачивает Вэй Ин, и тут же получает пожелание заткнуться. Ничего иного он от Бинхэ и не ожидал.\nХуа Чэн и Шэнь Вэй наблюдают всё происходящее молча: первый — с усмешкой на лице, второй — с лёгким беспокойством. Вэй Ин знает, что Князю демонов даже нравится наблюдать за подобными спорами, но не участвовать в них самому, а Темный посланник, наоборот, не любит конфликты. Но именно их реакция всегда самая интересная.\n— Может, сыграем, братец Хуа? — спрашивает Вэй Ин, зная, что у того всегда при себе кости.\nХуа Чэн кивает и сдвигает в сторону еду, освобождая центр стола. Никто не возражает, как и не выказывает особого энтузиазма.\n— И каковы будут ставки? — вежливо уточняет Шэнь Вэй. Вэй Ин не удивляется, ведь в этом пространстве без времени он вполне мог застать игру в кости впервые.\n— Самое ценное здесь — правда, — отвечает господин Смерть и кладёт подбородок на руки.\n— Стоит ли надеяться, что сегодня мы сможем уговорить на игру и этого господина? — спрашивает Вэй Ин, дурачась, но за этим скрывается настоящий интерес.\nКакое-то воспоминание настойчиво вертится в его голове, но его никак не удаётся ухватить за хвост. Они говорили об этом в тот первый раз, но он слишком сильно хотел напиться и перестать чувствовать себя трусом.\nГосподин Смерть смотрит на него пристально, от этого внимания продирает ознобом и обжигает кипятком. Алые блики в зелёных глазах завораживают, не отпускают. Но Вэй Ин по-настоящему хочет узнать это.\n— Если вы настаиваете, господа, — произносит он, и никто не смеет возражать.\nА Вэй Ин безуспешно пытается вспомнить, правда ли когда-то знал его имя. Такое простое и чуждое, имя из иного мира.\nОн надеется, что сегодня сможет задать этот вопрос снова.", "45540901000": "Они всегда всё делили на двоих — чувства, эмоции, воспоминания. Гарри не помнил времени, когда был один. Каждую секунду осознанной жизни с ним рядом всегда стоял друг. Близкий человек, готовый помогать и защищать, подбодрить или развеселить, всегда бывший на его стороне. Том.\nИ даже сейчас ничего не изменилось. Гарри стоял на перроне призрачного Кингс-Кросса не в одиночестве. От этого на душе стало легко и радостно. Кого ещё бы Гарри захотел увидеть перед тем, как окончательно умереть? Если бы ему разрешили выбирать, то это тоже был бы Том.\nПусть теперь Гарри знал, кто Том на самом деле — крестраж, кусочек чужой души, — но всё равно не мог злиться и обижаться. Не после семнадцати лет, прожитых бок о бок. За все эти годы Том не сделал ему ничего плохого, наоборот, даже слишком много хорошего.\nВ детстве Гарри не осознавал всех своих странностей, но всё началось уже тогда. Он помнил тихий, успокаивающий голос в своей голове, подсказывающий, когда лучше выбраться на кухню за едой, что ответить задирающим его мальчишкам и где спрятать любимые игрушки. Том рассказывал ему истории о волшебстве, но Гарри долго считал их просто сказками. Не хотел верить.\nТом говорил, что он особенный, а Гарри это не нравилось. Он с детства знал, как плохо отличаться от других, не важно, в какую сторону, и старался стать обычным. Гарри иногда делал странные вещи, но никогда не хотел этого и отрицал, списывая на совпадения. Том лишь вздыхал на его упрямство.\nГарри часто обуревали плохие эмоции. Ему хотелось что-то разрушить, кого-то ударить. Гарри знал — у него бы получилось, если бы он того захотел. Иногда это очень мешало — и мешало бы ещё сильнее, если бы не Том.\nГарри не представлял, как и зачем он это делал. Словно прохладная рука, которую положили на лоб, уносящая печаль и злость. Она успокаивала, утешала, помогала. Ненужные чувства уходили, словно бы их и не было. Но Гарри знал — они точно были. И Том забирал их у него, когда считал нужным.\nТак было всегда. Том был его главной тайной, самой оберегаемой и страшной. Гарри многое видел в магическом мире за семь лет, но никогда — ничего похожего. Это не было хорошим знаком, и ещё на первом курсе они с Томом решили, что никто не должен знать о его существовании.\nИ хоть этому секрету не раз угрожало раскрытие, Гарри везло. Возможно, это было отчаяние — то, с чем он раз от раза прятал Тома ото всех. Снейпа, Дамблдора, Волдеморта… Тех, кто смотрел на него слишком пристально и пытался заглянуть в голову.\nГарри повернулся к Тому, стоящему рядом, и наткнулся на ответный взгляд. В его голове были тысячи вопросов обо всём, но ни один не сорвался с губ. Гарри знал, что Том ответил бы правду. Он и раньше отвечал прямо, просто Гарри никогда не задавал нужных вопросов. Но на самом деле всё это не имело значения.\n— Почему ты… — начал Гарри голосом хриплым, словно от долгого сна, да так и не закончил. Заботился обо мне? Не помог Волдеморту? Здесь, со мной?\nВедь он и так знал все ответы.\nТом, выглядящий сейчас на несколько лет старшего его самого, лишь улыбнулся. Гарри впервые видел его улыбку, но она казалась такой знакомой. Ему даже не надо было смотреть или слушать, чтобы понять ответ. Они до сих пор были едины и слишком близки. Не один из них никогда не мог лгать другому.\nНа платформу подъехал поезд. Не Хогвартс-экспресс, а какой-то другой. Гарри с удивлением посмотрел на него, наконец отведя взгляд от Тома. И только потом заметил изменения в мире вокруг.\nВсё словно бы стало чётче, материальнее. Рядом с ними стояла скамейка, которой ещё недавно тут не было. А на ней лежал билет на поезд. Один. Том аккуратно взял его в руки, рассматривая, но в билете не было ничего примечательного. “В один конец” — гласила надпись.\n— Поезд в никуда, — протянул Том, и это стало первыми словами, что он произнёс здесь. Его голос был похож на тот, что был у воспоминания из дневника-крестража, но отличался. Гарри подумал, что хотел бы слушать его ещё и ещё.\n— Счастливого пути, — тихо произнёс Гарри. Он знал, для кого этот билет, и не собирался даже думать о другом исходе. Том заслуживал то, что ждало его впереди, а сам Гарри уже слишком устал. Его жизнь всё равно была бы непосильной ношей без Тома рядом. Идти вперёд без него не имело смысла.\nНо Том неожиданно взял его за руку, словно ребёнка, который может потеряться, а потом и вовсе переплёл их пальцы.\n— Вместе, Гарри. Только так, — произнёс он и снова улыбнулся.\nВ улыбках его Тома не было ничего от Волдеморта, прошлого или настоящего. Совсем другой человек. Гарри точно не знал, чем расплачивался создавший крестраж, но однозначно — чем-то важным. Тем, что нельзя было отдавать. Вечная жизнь в одиночестве… того не стоила.\n— Вместе, — согласился Гарри и тоже улыбнулся. Впервые за долгие месяцы.\nНе расцепляя рук, они вошли в поезд. Двери закрылись, и билет тут же рассыпался в пыль. Состав медленно тронулся с места. Сидя рядом с Томом, Гарри видел, как уплывает за окном призрачный Кингс-Кросс, всё больше растворяясь в тумане.\nИ неважно, куда отправился поезд. Ведь они были вместе.", "45540598000": "James’ fingers shook as he unbuttoned Sirius’ shirt. His silk tie was already loose around his shoulders, and his silver eyes were dark with hunger. Normally, James wouldn’t be nervous around Sirius. There was just no reason to be, not when they knew literally everything about each other. They’d been through hell and back over the last seven years, between full moons and Sirius’ family, and James’ parents passing… there wasn’t much that stood between them.\n\n“I love you,” James murmured, pressing a kiss into the crook of Sirius’ neck. \n\nThe words weren’t new, not when they’d been dating since third year, but they still felt precious every time he said them. It was an honour to love Sirius Black and one that James didn’t take lightly. His boyfriend had perfected a mask, a persona to use around anyone that wasn’t James- cold, emotionless, still. Even amongst the other marauders, Sirius still held a part of himself back.\n\nBut not with James. Never with James. \n\n“Hmm… I love you too, darling,” came the soft reply, a whisper pressed into James’ skin in between kisses. “Are you sure about this?”\n\n“I’m sure,” James said, sounding a lot more confident than he felt. \n\nThe thing was, he \n\nwas\n\n sure. They’d been messing about since fifth year, hand jobs, blow jobs, Sirius on top, James on top, all sorts of different kinks, but the one thing they hadn’t tried that James \n\nreally \n\nwanted to try… was using their animagus forms. That didn’t mean he wasn’t a little anxious too.\n\nWhen he’d first brought it up, James had been completely sozzled after a night out in Hogsmeade. He hadn’t really meant to say anything. It felt a bit taboo after all, but drunk James was a menace and could not be stopped. \n\n\n“All I’m saying, Pads,” he said as he slung his arm around his boyfriend, the pair of them stumbling up the steps to the Gryffindor Tower. “Is that Padfoot is part of you, Pads, and as your boyfriend, best friend and all round most brilliant person in your life-”\n\n\n\nSirius snorted. \n\n\n\n“Don’t laugh, it's important!”\n\n\n\n“Sure thing, Jamie.” \n\n\n\n“And as your boyfriend, I should get to know all of you, which includes Padfoot!”\n\n\nTo his surprise, Sirius had agreed. Apparently, he’d been thinking the same thing about Prongs, but they’d agreed to start with Padfoot as James had been brave enough to say something first, and it was easier to deal with Padfoot in the dorms. If they wanted Prongs to come out, then they would have to retreat to somewhere with a little more space. James was rather proud of his antlers and he didn’t want to scrape them all down the walls and get them muddled in the curtains. \n\nSirius’ lips pressed against his, soft yet insistent, pulling James back into the moment. Long fingers trailed down James’ bare chest, running through the dark hair that had grown there in recent years. James moaned into the kiss as he was pushed back down onto the mattress, and he was suddenly grateful for the plug that Sirius had worked into him that morning. He wasn’t sure his nerves could wait any longer. \n\n“Okay, do it,” James gasped, pushing Sirius back off him. \n\nHe watched the man become the beast, Sirius melting away until Padfoot stood in his place, but even then there was no denying that they were one. Familiar silver eyes watched him, the same hunger present as had been before. It was easy to forget just how \n\nbig \n\nPadfoot was, nearly the size of a wolf, and James swallowed, his mouth going dry. \n\nFrom the bed, he could see Sirius’ dick, long and red as it poked out from under the fur. It wasn’t the first time Sirius had been aroused around James in this form, but it \n\nwas\n\n the first time they intended to do something about it. James stared, fixated on Sirius’ cock as his hands slowly stroked down his chest. He shuddered as his fingers wrapped around his own cock, the sensations lighting up his body. Fuck, he couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt quite this desperate to be fucked. It probably didn’t help that the damned plug had been teasing him all day, distracting him during his classes, but it was more than that. \n\nThis felt… forbidden, dangerous. \n\nJames glanced at the door, quickly picking up his wand and checking it was locked and that the silencing charms were in place. Normally the thought of people walking in on them heightened his arousal, but this was different. It was private, something that only they could know. \n\nPadfoot barked before jumping onto the bed, his nose was wet against James’ cheek as he gave James a quick lick. \n\n“Yeah, I’m good, more than good actually.”\n\nLetting his fingers drag through Sirius’ fur, James slowly guided the dog downwards, earning himself a huff and an eye roll from the animagus, but Padfoot’s tail wagging behind him gave him away. Padfoot whined softly as his nose brushed along James' abs, and then he lifted his head, tilting it in a silent question, pressing against James’ hand behind his ears. \n\n“Go on, Pads,” pleaded James. He didn’t take his eyes off Padfoot as the dog began to nuzzle at his cock. \n\nPadfoot’s nose knocked James’ hand away before he lapped at the hard length. His tongue was rougher than a human’s, long, insistent as it worked messily. A moan tore from James’s throat and he arched off the bed, his eyes fluttering shut without his permission. \n\nNo. \n\nHe wanted to watch. \n\nIt took all his effort to open them again, propping himself up on his elbows so he could properly see Padfoot work. As a human, Sirius was a talented cocksucker, but the skill didn’t seem to transfer so easily to his dog form. He licked and whined and nuzzled at James’ cock without any thought, lapping up any pre-cum that dripped from the slit, and yet it was probably one of the hottest things James had ever seen. \n\n“Oh fuck!” he groaned as he tugged at his own hair. \n\nPadfoot, the bastard, had the audacity to wink at him, his tail still wagging steadily. \n\nJames had had enough. He didn’t want to cum like this, not this time at any rate. He took a shaky breath as he tried to push Padfoot back, but the dog was stronger than Sirius, and James was promptly ignored.\n\n“Pads, no. Get off! Oh shit!” \n\nThe dog barked. Finally, he let up on his attack on James’ cock, his nose cold as it pressed between James’ cheeks. Padfoot let out a whine and sat back on his haunches, looking at James expectantly. He barked again. \n\nJames frowned as he peered at his boyfriend. When he didn’t immediately do whatever Padfoot was asking, the dog nosed again at his hole, jostling the plug with his snout. \n\nOh. \n\nThe plug. \n\nAs a dog, Sirius couldn’t remove it. James smirked, catching his breath as he felt his nearing orgasm starting to slowly wane. Sirius didn’t like being helpless and right now there was nothing he could do about the plug, not unless he changed back to human but neither of them wanted that. \n\nJames’ kept his gaze on Sirius as he trailed his finger along his thighs, pinching slightly at the skin. He let out a quiet gasp at that sharp pain, biting down on his lip, before teasing at the plug, pushing it in a little deeper before beginning to ease it out. \n\nBut clearly not fast enough. \n\nPadfoot growled, his large paw batting at James’ hand. \n\n“Okay, okay… Gimme a moment.”\n\nAnother growl. \n\nJames rolled his eyes but did as he was told. The plug tugged at his rim on the way out and he squeezed his eyes shut, trying to contain his pleasure. “Oh, Merlin…” His fingers were sticky now, lube trickling down his thighs and onto the sheets below. They’d used a lot of it earlier on purpose, not knowing how easy it would be to slick up Padfoot’s cock without it. But apparently, that wasn’t going to be a problem. “Ah fuck!”\n\nPadfoot’s tongue pressed into him, licking deeper than Sirius’ tongue ever could. It was relentless as he thrust his tongue into James’ hole, lapping around the rim before diving back in, again and again. It was hot and wet and overwhelming. Fur brushed against James’ cheek, a reminder of just who was eating him out. \n\n“No, no, no!” James groaned, gripping his cock tightly. “Not like this, Pads, \n\nplease.\n\n”\n\nThe dog whined in protest but pulled back, although not for long. Sirius seemed to be losing a part of his humanity the longer he stayed as Padfoot, a feeling James was well accustomed to. The wildness of Prongs was something that he couldn’t explain, but it was freeing and exhilarating and he couldn’t imagine his life without it now that he had it. Padfoot was more desperate than Sirius, a wild edge beyond the level-headed boy… and oh Merlin was James benefitting.\n\nPadfoot headbutted him, barking and pushing until James was on his hands and knees on the bed. \n\nThis was it. \n\nHe cried out as Padfoot’s claws hit his back, wincing at the pain. That would leave a mark in the morning, but nothing that wasn’t fixable… hopefully. Padfoot’s heavy body pressed against him, hot and soft. The fur tickled his skin. Fur. Padfoot. Animagus. \n\nFuck. They were actually doing this. \n\nA howl rang out in the dorm and Padfoot started to thrust, rutting desperately against James’ arse. He growled in frustration as his cock kept missing its target, moving between James’ cheeks but never quite catching his hole. James wanted to help but he was stuck, pinned to the mattress by the weight on top of him. He grunted, twisting the sheets beneath his fingers as he tried to shift his position to make it easier for the dog. \n\nOne moment he was empty, the next he was stuffed full of cock. A broken moan fell from his lips. It was a lot, edging on the wrong side of pleasure and pain, but James just tried to focus on his breathing. Sirius would never intentionally hurt him, and he knew the pain would ease soon enough. Normally, Sirius would wait, stay still until James had adjusted, but Padfoot didn’t think. He was thrusting into James at a relentless pace, hard and deep and fast. His claws dug into James’ back, scratching along his spine. \n\n“Fuck, Si, Pads… oh- oh fuck!” James cursed, his glasses falling from his face as he looked down, but he didn’t care. He didn’t need to see anymore. There was no mistaking the long cock that was impaling him, the thick fur against his skin, the scraping claws down his back. \n\nIt was all Padfoot. \n\nThe dog growled and snarled and whined, fucking into James as if he were a bitch in heat. Now wasn’t that a thought? James moaned, happy to be used by his boyfriend. Gods, he couldn’t wait to wake up in the morning, still sore and bruised. He would feel this for days. And the cock was still growing inside him, getting longer, thicker the closer Padfoot got to his release. But there was something more… \n\nA knot. \n\nFuck. James had forgotten about that. \n\nHe felt his eyes go wide as the knot started to swell. He cursed, gripping the sheets tightly. He was already so full. There was no way it was going to fit, but neither of them could stop now. It was a frenzy of pleasure, fucking and thrusting and rutting. There were moans. There was panting. Whines and whimpers. Padfoot hit James’ prostate with nearly every thrust, sending sparks across his vision as his pleasure mounted. The world was foggy beyond the two of them and the feel of Padfoot’s cock pounding into him. James could feel himself slipping, pulled under by the pain and pleasure. \n\n“Si,” he whined weakly, his voice hoarse and his head spinning. \n\nThe dog just howled, mouthing at James’ shoulder, teeth catching on his skin. The knot tugged at his rim, stretching him wider than he’d ever been stretched before, and James was floating, the weight of Padfoot on top of him was the only tether he had to his body. Pleasure building. Claws scratching. So full. So good. \n\n\nSo good. \n\n\nHis orgasm washed over him, twisting at his core, heat burning across his skin. He moaned, sinking into the feeling as he felt Sirius cum inside him, flooding his insides. It was bordering on uncomfortable as the dog rutted against him, driving his seed deeper inside of James. The knot locked them together, stopping anything from escaping him. He was full and happy as he collapsed onto the bed, Padfoot landing on top of him with a soft “woof.”\n\nSirius didn’t turn back right away, not until the knot had gone down and his cock was soft and nestled inside James. James wasn’t even sure how long it had been. He was still feeling floaty, and he was pretty sure he’d dozed off for a while there, but he came too to Sirius’ lips brushing against his shoulder. \n\n“‘M sorry,” his boyfriend whispered, his fingers trailing down James’ back. “This looks sore.”\n\nJames didn’t have the energy to shake his head so he just hummed. “‘S fine… ‘m good. Don’t pull out yet…”\n\nSirius pressed his head between James’ shoulder blades. “I won’t. I’m here. I love you.”\n\nThe words made James smile into his pillow. “Love you too, Si.”", "45540516999": ["The night had started out normally. James was sitting by the fire with his parents, reading a book, when there was a knock at the door. James went to answer it. Outside was Regulus, Sirius’s little brother. He had cuts and bruises all over his arms and legs, tears streaking down his bruised cheeks. That was probably where James drifted off, just outside the door. Everything was blurred, despite the fact he was wearing his glasses. The world had shifted, become a darker place. He could feel it, deep in his bones, from the moment he saw Regulus, bruised and bloody. Regulus was now inside, and the door was open, but James didn’t want to go inside. He wanted to go to Grimmauld Place and kill Walburga and Orion Black. He wanted to so badly, but his feet felt glued to the ground, tears streaming down his cheeks. James’ mother came out after ten, twenty minutes. She didn’t try to take him inside, she was smarter than that, hugging him instead. She must have felt it too.", "", "Regulus had been told to sleep but he couldn’t, wouldn’t. There was a hollowness in his chest, something missing, and that thing was Sirius. Effie Potter had bandaged his wounds, but she couldn’t make things better. She couldn’t bring Sirius back. She couldn’t fix him. He didn’t want to blink because if he blinked, he would see Sirius and if he saw Sirius he would cry and crying is weakness, but for one fucking moment, he deserved to be weak, to cry. He didn’t know why he was there. Why did he come to the Potter’s? The same reason he didn’t save Sirius. He was scared. Why didn’t he let Sirius leave. If Sirius had left, he would still be alive. If Regulus had gone with him, they could both be safe and happy. Now Sirius was dead in a house he never wanted to be in, Remus dead with him. Regulus cried that night, for the first time in years.", "", "James heard Regulus crying. He didn’t deserve to be crying. He had let Sirius get hurt and Sirius was only hurt, right? He couldn’t be dead. James wasn’t sure what he intended to do when he opened the door to the guest room. It was the one Sirius always used. Regulus was crying. James had heard it, but he wasn’t prepared for what it looked like. Regulus looked so small, so fragile, his eyes hollow and filled with tears. He was curled up in a ball, sobbing as he stared out the window. He was staring at Sirius’s star and the moon. Oh merlin, Moony. He would be so hurt. So broken. They had just started dating in the spring. James couldn’t take it. He couldn’t take the stifling aura of tragedy choking him, the sadness and trauma radiating off of the small teenage boy next to the window. James couldn’t take it, so he left. He hid in his room and cried. He cried for so long. The moon and stars seemed so dim tonight. James wondered if they would stay this dim forever.", "", "Regulus didn’t want to leave the guest room in the morning, even when Effie came to bring him down for breakfast. She had to levitate him to get him downstairs. He hadn’t told anyone what happened and he didn’t want them to ask. Effie held his hand as she led him downstairs, which was somewhat comforting, but he wanted to hide in the room and fade away into nothingness. He wanted to fade into whatever void his brother was in. A part of him knew he wouldn’t go to the same place as Sirius. He was too good to go where Regulus is going.", "“Good morning, Regulus,” James said quietly as Regulus took a seat.", "“Would you like coffee or tea, love?” Effie asked. Regulus stared down at his toast.", "“Tea please.” Effie got right to making it. At a point in time, she would have been the only Potter he could tolerate, but in his present situation, he liked the comforting warmth that all the Potter’s gave off.", "“James, after breakfast, how about you show Regulus around the town?” James simply nodded.", "Regulus didn’t eat his breakfast. He brought his tea to his room and hid until James came to get him.", "“Mum said I should take you around town,” James said, leaning on the doorframe.", "“I don’t want to,” Regulus replied, making sure not to look into James’ eyes.", "“Well, I can take you out or we can stay here and talk,” James said, crossing his arms.", "“What do we have to talk about?’ Regulus asked, tensing up.", "James unfolded his arms and walked up to the bed. “For starters, what happened last night.”", "Regulus clenched his fists. “I don’t want to talk about it.”", "“But don’t I deserve to know?” James’s voice was getting louder. Tears flooded Regulus’s eyes.", "“I said, I DON’T WANT TO TALK ABOUT IT!” Regulus yelled, tears streaming down his cheeks. James’s expression calmed. He sat down and put his arms around Regulus. “He’s gone, James. He’s not coming back,” Regulus said quietly. He heard James sobbing quietly. Regulus swore that he would tell him everything soon. But for today, they would share the loss, share the tears, and feel a little better."], "45540517000": "", "45540295000": "It was absolutely an accident and a fluke on Remus’ part, the way this weird birthday gift-giving tradition started with Sirius.While everyone else seem to be be normal human beings and gave Remus a birthday card and a hug and maybe some candy for his sweet-tooth, Sirius had to go and make it into something big. And Remus knows perfectly well that it had been his own fault for encouraging this, but he can’t take all the credit - at first, he was 100% kidding and later, James and Peter all but begged him to not stop. So he (accidentally) didn’t.//The first year, when the other three boys learned of his birthday, James was talking about having a birthday party (which Remus categorically forbade) and Sirius turned towards Remus in their dorm.They were sitting on the floor, in a comfortable circle, studying for history of magic (or were trying to, Sirius had just been staring at the ceiling and singing under his breath) when the other boy fixed Remus with a quizzical look.“So, what do you want for your birthday?” Sirius asked, earnest.Remus had never had friends - not like this. No other group of people (or even just one) had been so immune to his grumpiness, to his whims, to his blatant sarcasm and however he tried, he couldn’t shake the three boys. So, really, it was kind of sad but all he wanted for his birthday was for these friends to stick - to stay his friends.“Nothing,” he said, short as ever, eyes going over the line in his book again because watching Sirius sing turned out to be more fascinating than Goblin wars.“Come on! There’s gotta be something, even the tiniest thing!” Sirius pleaded, now sitting up.Uh oh, Remus thought. Sirius had apparently found another distraction from studying - annoying Remus.He ignored Sirius completely, eyes back to the textbook. James sat up, too. “Okay, no party. Just us four, yeah? Peter, quiz me.”Remus gave James a rather thankful glance, but the boy had already turned to Peter, still smiling. Remus tried to hide his own soft smile - James Potter, always out for everyone’s happiness, without realising it.But Sirius wasn’t backing down. He kept poking Remus with his long fingers, whining about how “There has to be something!” and “Come on, lay it on me!”.Finally, after reading the same line for the tenth time, Remus burst out, “I don’t bloody know, a 100 chocolate frogs!”That shut Sirius up and he seemed mildly surprised by Remus’ outburst - only because he was usually so quiet and distant.But there was a bright smile that made its way onto his face then and he said, “Like chocolate then, do you?”Remus rolled his eyes and went back to ignoring him.But the next morning, he was woken up by the three boys piling onto his bed, jumping and singing Happy Birthday.And Sirius, carrying a large bag, emptied it onto his bed and the rest of them watched in shock and awe as chocolate frogs spilled everywhere, falling onto the floor.James started laughing, dragging Peter along and Sirius was beaming, proud.Remus tried his best but the stupid smile still made its way onto his face. “You idiot, I was kidding!” he said but he couldn’t sound mad even if he tried.Sirius just shrugged but his eyes were bright when he said, “Happy birthday, Remus!”//During the second year, they were walking along the corridor, just Remus and Sirius, while Remus was trying his best to memorise the potions notes in front of him. “snake fangs, porcupine quills, flobberworm mucus…” he mumbled to himself, feeling frantic.He’d missed the potion’s lesson last week due to the full moon and was now required to go and start on his Boil-Cure potion while Sirius and James went to the Quidditch tryouts. Which is where Sirius was now heading, having promised to meet James early on the pitch to get a head start on practising with Peter cheering on from the stands.“Lupin? Remus!” Sirius’ voice brought Remus back from his notes but he wasn’t happy about it.“What?” he snapped, making Sirius frown at him momentarily but it dissipated rather quickly.“So, what do you want for your birthday this year?” Sirius asked and Remus groaned.“Sirius, I really don’t bloody care about my-”“Come off it, you know I won’t stop asking.” Sirius cut him off and yeah, Remus was familiar with Sirius’ tactics in annoying anyone into doing anything (completely opposite from James who just simply asked nicely, and Peter, who just somehow always managed to get his way without even having to work for it. Remus guessed it was because Peter had very sweet, convincing puppy eyes.)“Stir three times clockwise… not wait, was it-” Remus muttered, trying to find the right page.Sirius knocked into him gently but it still pissed Remus off.“So? Reeeemuuuuus…” Sirius said it in a sing-song voice and it would’ve been irritating if he didn’t have such a fucking good singing voice.“I don’t fucking know… Three times clockwise sounds right yeah… a bloody unicorn for all I care, I have to go. I’m late.” Remus said, rushing towards the dungeons, leaving a very smug looking Sirius behind.When Remus’ birthday came around, it wasn’t what he expected.He’d completely forgotten about the unicorn comment and there Sirius was, presenting him with a toy plushie unicorn, baby blue with a sparkling horn and wings to match.Remus took it, feeling the softness in his hand. He was so stunned, he had no clue what to say. When you were a teenager, shit like this didn’t usually fly (because honestly, they weren’t little kids anymore) but Remus didn’t even have a mind to toss the bloody thing back to Sirius with some curse words.James peeked over his shoulder (Remus had, once again, outgrown them all) and gave an appreciative hum. “Nice colour.” he commented. There was no malicious intent in his voice but Sirius still defended himself.“Real unicorns are bloody hard to catch!” his cheeks were slightly tinted pink.Remus held the toy, feeling something warm inside of him grow and grow until he felt utterly uncomfortable.But Sirius said, “It’s magical, though. So, close enough. Flies and shit, go ahead, toss it.”Remus gave him a raised eyebrow.“Over here, Remus! Toss it,” Peter volunteered from the other side of the room.Remus, feeling stupid, threw the toy. Silver sparks flew from it and the toy came to life for a second, whinnying and flapping its glittering blue wings, soaring below the ceiling of their dorm before it landed in Peter’s hands.They all stared. Peter was the first to start laughing, followed by James. “Oh, brilliant!” he said, thoroughly amused.Remus gave Sirius a smile. He got one back and the warm feeling was still present, but less restrictive to his breathing.“Wanted to make it shoot rainbows out of its butt as well but didn’t have time.” Sirius then said, which only made James and Peter laugh harder, falling to the floor with Peter still clutching the toy. Remus laughed, too.Sirius beamed at him when Remus finally set the toy onto his bed, next to his pillow.//When Remus’ friends found out about his ‘furry problem’, like James’ liked to refer to it, he was terrified.Terrified they’d leave them, scared they would treat him differently.They didn’t leave (to Remus’ surprise) but they did treat Remus differently - with more care, worry. Remus didn’t exactly like it but he would have taken it instead of despise any day.“Moony?” Sirius asked and the nickname had come around at the start of the year and had stuck - Remus found he didn’t mind. He hadn’t had nicknames before, hard to have them without friends to give them to you, and his father’s nicknames for him were all embarrassing anyways.“Hm?” Remus was holding his head in between his hands. Madam Pomfrey had let him leave that morning, following the full moon, but somehow this one had taken its toll more than usual. He was getting older, more mature, and so was the wolf. The transformations had begun to feel more painful and more awful than ever before.Remus feared what the coming years would bring.“Birthday, you.” Sirius said, short and to the point.Remus groaned against the pounding of his head. “Bugger off.”At that exact point, Lily Evans plopped down next to him. “Hiya, Remus! I wanted to ask you about that potion - Slughorn says we should check it every other 6 hours so maybe you could-”She went on and Remus tried his best to listen, nodding, head still in his hands. “Is that okay?” she finished.Remus nodded again, not knowing what he was agreeing to. “So, birthday?” Sirius asked once more.“Oh, right, it’s almost here isn’t it? What are you doing for it, Remus?” Lily asked, clearly still there. Remus peered at her, reaching for mashed potatoes. The great hall had begun to fill with students as it was apparently lunchtime.“Ugh, I could kill for a pumpkin pasty.” Marlene McKinnon said, plopping down next to Lily.“There you go,” Lily glanced at the table, picked one up and handed it to her. Marlene looked positively smitten, at least from what Remus could tell from between his fingers.“You’re an angel.” Marlene said.“I can attest to that,” James quickly cut in.Lily seemed unimpressed. “Flattery will get you nowhere, Potter.”“But-”“Remus, what do you want for your birthday?” Sirius again, cutting in.“Moony, tell Lily that my flattery has definitely gotten me places.” James pleaded, clearly taking a hit to his honour with Lily’s comment.Remus groaned.“Remus,” Peter this time, across the table, “I know you’re probably not feeling your best but about that Transfiguration homework…”“What do you want for your birthd-” Sirius was cut off by Remus' head plopping onto the table with such force, a fork flew off next to him and Lily had to take a hold of her goblet so it didn’t spill pumpkin juice all over the table.“Some fucking peace and quiet would be nice!” Remus bit out to Sirius, agitated and the pounding in his head became worse.There was a collective silence around them, save for the other students in the great hall who hadn’t witnessed his small breakdown.He swallowed, sighed and opened his eyes, straightening up. Everyone was staring at him with varying degrees of worry. He tried smiling, but he knew it looked odd and fake. “Peter, I’ll help you tonight. Evans, I’ve got the night shift. Also, James’ flattery has gotten him places - just ask any of the Hufflepuffs. I’m going upstairs for a nap.”He ignored Sirius’ hand that shot out to stop him and ignored Peter’s questions about his health. Getting out of the Great Hall, his headache didn’t let up so crawling into bed in their dorms, he did his best to just drift away into what he hoped would be a dreamless sleep.The next morning, everything was quiet. Remus tried to figure out why that surprised him but he then realised - it was his birthday and usually, his three best friends were already on his bed and showering him with suffocating hugs and affection. This time, it was more quiet in the dorm than after the time Gryffindor lost to Slytherin in a deciding match.Remus peered over his covers, seeing only empty beds. He also realised  he’d missed breakfast. With a groan, he went back under the covers, hopefully he could shield himself from the world that way.No such luck, as the dorm room opened and the three boys stepped in.“Moony?” Sirius spoke in a half-whisper and Remus found himself appreciating it immensely. He relented the cover, to peer over it again. Sirius was looking at him all weird - he hadn’t looked at him like that before, not that Remus could remember. Soft and steady.“We brought you food.” James said, matching Sirius' level of tone, putting everything (which was A LOT) onto the nightstand.“Here,” Peter said, putting a bunch of cards and gifts on Remus’ bed, “Gifts from the rest of the tower.”Remus stared at them.“Happy birthday,” they said, quietly and almost at the same time.Remus kept staring, utterly confused.“See, we figured… I mean, Sirius figured,” James started but changed course when Sirius shoved him gently, “that you could just stay in for the rest of the day? We already told the teachers you’re not feeling well and Pomfrey vouched for you. And Sirius went and told everyone not to bother you so we collected all the gifts ourselves and promised to give you their wishes, too.”“If that’s alright? If you want the commotion then we can just-” Sirius looked uncertain of his choice now but Remus shook his head so fast it spun.“No, this is- It’s perfect, actually.” he managed to say, feeling his cheeks flare up. He had to look away from Sirius quickly, those grey eyes still so damn soft. What the fuck was happening?“So, happy birthday from everyone else, too!” Peter squeaked, feeling pleased by the turn of events.“Mary told us that we should also kiss you Happy Birthday.” Sirius now said, a cheeky smile on his face. James and Peter suddenly matched his expression.“Oh, no- no!” Remus half-shouted when the three boys piled on his bed and started trying to kiss his face where they could reach.Remus struggled, trying his best to fight against them but it was hopeless. James managed a kiss to his forehead, Peter to his nose and Sirius, holding Remus’ face still with a surprisingly firm hand on his jaw, kissed him on his cheek.Remus was burning up, when they all finally pulled back. “Fucking idiots.” he mumbled, staring at the ceiling helplessly. And then, “Thank you.”They all beamed at him, bidding him goodbye for the day and promised to bring him up dinner. Remus reached for the birthday cards when Sirius called to him from the door.Remus looked up, seeing him staring back, a dopey smile on his face. “Happy birthday, Moony.”He rolled his eyes but smiled back to Sirius all the same.//Fourth year brought about many revelations. The most pressing of them was that Remus realised he was crushing on one of his best friends.He kept it locked down tight in fear of losing what they had - the Marauders, the four of them causing mischief and wreaking havoc wherever they went.This was also the year where Remus was acutely aware of Sirius’ antics concerning his birthday. James and Peter always went big, too - their gifts made Remus smile bashfully and say that he could never repay them - to which they waved their hands in dismissal. “They’re gifts, Moony,” they would say. And that was that.So, knowing his own attraction to Sirius and Sirius’ way of trying to give absolutely anything to Remus for his birthday, it stirred some thoughts.A lot of thoughts. Remus found himself awake at night, thinking of all the things he could ask Sirius - things that made him selfish. Things he’d never actually have the courage to ask. He tried to rid himself of these thoughts and focused on his studies, his reading and newfound fondness of David Bowie, which is all that Sirius listened to.So, when Sirius asked the inevitable question, “So, this year, Moony? What’s it gonna be?”, Remus didn’t even think.“David Bowie’s autograph,” he replied, sucking on the tip of his quill in the common room, where he was trying to figure out where on earth Saturn was supposed to be in the sky that week. ”Peter, can you give me a hand here?”Peter shuffled over, pointing. “That’s not Jupiter, Remus. And Saturn goes over here.” he said, helpfully.“That’s too easy,” James said from his place in front of the fireplace, playing with the Snitch.Remus narrowed his eyes. “Did you steal the Snitch again? James.” his tone was chastising.“I’m only borrowing it!” James said, smirking. His eyes flickered to Lily across the room, where she was engrossed in conversation with Mary and Marlene.“Give it up, mate.” Sirius said, following the trajectory of his eyes and then frowned, “What do you mean, too easy?”“Well, anyone could fake an autograph. Plus, they sell them, I’m guessing.” Peter interjected, scratching something off Remus’ charts.He let him, knowing that Peter was much better at Astronomy than he was.Sirius seemed stuck. For a moment, Remus wanted to say that he was, once again, joking (which he was), when Sirius' face lit up.“I’ll get you a genuine, personal David Bowie autograph. Like, a personal wish and all.” he said, confident.Remus snorted. “Mhmm.” He hummed, thanking Peter and looking over his chart.“What, you think I can’t do it?” Sirius asked, in a challenge, one eyebrow raised delicately. Remus swallowed and looked away quickly.“Sirius, I was just fucking around.”But, apparently, Sirius was not.His birthday morning started like any other, only Sirius wasn’t there. When Remus eyed his empty bed and gave a questioning look to James and Peter, who had already showered him with birthday wishes, they both shrugged but clearly looked confused as well, which meant Sirius hadn’t confided anything to them.It all was revealed when they were in the Great Hall, finishing breakfast and already planning on going on the lookout for Sirius or at least report his absence, when he strode in.He was holding a thin package in his hand, kind of like a huge envelope. He was smiling from ear to ear.Remus already felt his heart thudding in his chest and he couldn’t look away. Fuck Sirius Black for looking absolutely stunning.He didn’t sit, but came straight to Remus, stopped and handed the envelope/package over.Remus stared at him, mouth slightly open and whispered, “You didn’t.”“Open it.” Sirius said, raising a brow.Remus swallowed and his shaky fingers went to the paper, ripping it carefully. James and Peter were wearing the same awestruck expressions. Remus slipped the large piece of paper out, which turned out to be a poster of David Bowie. He had a pinstriped costume on, a plunging V-neck revealing skin, his hair as red as his boots. He looked as marvellous as ever.Remus tried not to blush and let his eyes go over the picture until he reached the bottom. His mouth hung even more open in shock, if that was possible. “Is that…No-” he said, aware that he was stuttering.Sirius was practically vibrating next to him in excitement. “Go on! Read it!”Remus gave Sirius a quick glance - a mistake, he felt even more out of breath seeing the red in Sirius’ cheekbones, his eyes alight - and read the dedication at the bottom in big loopy handwriting. “Dear Remus, Happy birthday. Blow their minds! - David.” And there, the autograph as well, below the birthday wish.Remus, honest to god, thought he was going to cry right then and there.James whistled. “Damn, that’s-”“Fucking hell, Sirius.” Peter joined in, peering at the poster.Remus let the two inspect it, leaving it on the table as he stood. Sirius was beaming, glowing. He’d never looked more beautiful to Remus then.He leaned in, hugging him tight. Sirius’ hands went to his back, clutching tightly as he whispered, “Happy birthday, Moony.” to his ear, making Remus shiver slightly.He pulled back, still close enough that he could keep holding onto Sirius if he wanted to. He wanted to, but he dropped his arms, just in case anyone was observing. “Thank you.” he said, quiet and soft. He hated that the emotion seeped through.But Sirius didn’t seem to mind, only smiled. Smiled at Remus like he’d just made his day, not the other way around. Remus glanced back at the poster, biting his lip when a smile threatened to spill.“Wait, so did you meet him?” James asked.Remus whipped his head to Sirius so quickly, there was an audible crack.While Sirius laughed, Remus rubbed his neck and asked, “Did you??”Sirius smiled secretively but said nothing.“Sirius,” Remus started but Sirius was already walking backwards, waving and exiting the hall. “Did you meet him!?”Sirius tapped his own nose with a knowing look. Remus spluttered when Sirius turned around to leave.“Sirius Black, did you fucking meet David Bowie!?”//“Moony, can I make a suggestion?” James asked lazily, from his bed, where he was making it snow from the ceiling.“Yes, Prongs, I think you can.” Remus allowed, from his own bed, reading.“This ought to be good,” Peter mumbled from his bed, where he was trying to figure out why he had two socks without their partners.Sirius was also sitting on his own bed, legs crossed, and pointed his wand towards James. “No, you may not, because it’s Remus’ gift and he is supposed to say what he wants. You can’t just influence him into ridiculousness”James snorted, stopping the snowfall and got up to sit as well. He raised his eyebrows. “Not like we totally don’t influence him into pranks with us, right?”“In your defence, I am very easily influenced.” Remus replied steadily, smiling behind the book.“That’s different! It’s for his own good,” Sirius said fervently, “Besides. He’s basically the mastermind behind those pranks, someone’s got to utilise that big, beautiful brain of his.” Sirius winked at him.Remus rolled his eyes but was secretly glad the book was hiding his cheeks. He kept blushing whenever Sirius would so much as smile at him, which was fucking annoying.“Padfoot, he’s too good to exploit your willingness to give him whatever he wants but we're not. And since Moony secretly knows I’m right and you need your ego to be knocked down a peg,” Sirius protested while Remus and Peter said ‘here, here’ in unison, “I can help him out a bit.”Sirius stared at Peter in betrayal and then directed his glare to Remus, who quickly ignored it.“And?” Sirius asked, grumpily.James widened his hands as if for show. “Lightning in a bottle.”Remus snorted loudly.There was a small silence and Remus lowered his book to see the rest of the Marauders staring at him. He shrugged. “Oh, you know, I was just imagining Sirius running around the grounds with a glass bottle, getting shocked by lighting here and there.”This made Peter and James laugh and even Sirius lips twitched a bit. But he puffed out his chest. “The Great Hall has lighting in the skies, so it can’t be that hard.”“That’s extremely advanced magic, Sirius.” James told him, amused.“Um, hello? Unregistered animagus’, sitting right here?” Sirius pointed to himself, Peter and then James.“He has a point, we’re incredibly intelligent and powerful for our age.” James agreed now, a touch of humour in his voice.“Oh, yes, could pass the NEWT’s right away if given the chance.” Peter agreed.“Incredibly full of yourselves, you mean,” Remus directed his comment at James who winked. See, when James did that, Remus didn’t feel the need to blush like a fucking idiot. So unfair.Sirius clapped his hands together. “Consider it done!”Remus sighed, getting back to his book, and ignoring the way Sirius’ words made his heart swell in his chest.They were huddled around in the common room next month, with Remus in the middle.“It’s beautiful!” Lily commented, tapping at the bottle.The lighting inside flashed as she did so. Marlene watched in awe but Dorcas scoffed. “Lighting in a bottle… You losing your game, Sirius?” she teased.Sirius raised a brow. If it was Remus, he would’ve melted but it was directed at Dorcas, who barked a laugh instead of combusting.“I mean, the David Bowie thing…” she drawled.“Yeah, that was the best so far, I think.” Mary agreed, looking at the lighting as well. She took it into her hands to shake it a bit.Remus grabbed it. “Don’t break it!” he didn’t even realise the tone of his voice until they all stared at him.James smirked. “Or maybe,” he started, with a very sickly sweet tone, “Remus likes it even better than the Bowie poster.”He felt his face turn red again, but he tried to deflect, “Well, I’m just guessing this isn’t simple magic. Would be a waste if weeks of work would be undone by Mary’s clumsiness.”“Hey!” Mary said, insulted, but she was also smiling.Sirius seemed pleased to no extent. Then, he frowned. “Wait, how do you know it took me weeks?”Remus tried his best not to meet anyone’s eye, instead staring at the small lightning storm in his hands. Truthfully, he spent so much time observing Sirius, it was hard not to notice how much he’d disappeared lately.“You’ve been to the library more than me, Padfoot.” he said, hoping his lie was convincing enough.Peter snorted. “That’s definitely true.”“So that’s why you blew off Quidditch with me the other day? Wanker!” James now realised, shoving Sirius.Remus felt his cheeks still glowing with heat and his chest swelled with the knowledge that Sirius had blown off James - for him.“Happy birthday, Moons.” Sirius said, bumping his shoulder to Remus’ slightly.The girls cooed.“Fuck off,” Remus said, taking the bottle with him towards the dorms.“We love you, too!” Lily shouted after him. Remus flipped them off.But, when it was time for bed and they went under their covers, Remus set the bottle on his nightstand and caught Sirius watching him from his bed.Remus blushed, but rolled his eyes. “Don’t let this go to your head.” he said to Sirius, leaning back onto his own bed.Sirius’ face had a peculiar expression, one Remus couldn’t read, but the corner of his mouth lifted into a small smile. “One can only hope.”//Remus was woken up from a very, very nice and vivid dream. He’d been running through the forest with Padfoot, in his wolf form, but it hadn’t been scary or painful. It was nice, nothing but the night air and smell of rain around them, free and wild. And then, the dream hand changed to him and Sirius lying on a bed of grass, blue skies as far as the eye could see, chasing down different shapes of clouds.One of those clouds looked weirdly like Wormtail in his rat form, only it had a tutu on it. Remus still remembers how Sirius smelled in the dream - of something sweet, like honey. He’d just been leaning in when he was awoken.Not entirely sure what it was that woke him, Remus blinked dazedly, when he heard a ‘Bloody hell’ come from James’ bed.Remus sat up, vaguely aware that he could still smell that sweet aroma. He blinked and then blinked again.The whole room was covered in wildflowers. Daisies, white as a sheet, beautifully delicate violets, water parsnips with a pink hue, buttercups, yellow as the Sun.So that’s what he had been smelling. It all brings the dream back too vividly and his skin tingles, remembering the closeness to Sirius.The flowers were strewn across the floor, from the ceiling in long rows like string lights, all over their four beds and nightstands.“Jesus, Padfoot.” Peter said from where he was gathering the petals into his hands and letting them fall, watching Remus in amusement for his reaction.Remus was speechless, inhaling the sweet aroma.He looked up when he heard the door and saw Sirius enter, unaware that he was being observed. His head was down and he was mumbling about something and with a jolt, Remus realised he was holding sunflowers, four of them.When Remus had obsessed over botany for the better part of their 6th year, finding it to be his new fixation, his birthday wish had been ‘to lay on a field of wildflowers’, jokingly. His friends didn’t tease him for this fixation.Remus hadn’t even considered that Sirius would bring the whole thing to him.He looked a bit bashful, when he skipped over the flowers to reach Remus’ bed. His cheeks were tinged pink, while Remus gave him a smirk.Over the past year, they had been doing a sort of dance. Remus, first acknowledging his crush, had blushed whenever Sirius winked at him, complimented him.  Had endured jealousy over Sirius’ various partners, had drowned his own infatuation into others. Was forced to be robbed of his breath when Siriuis was around and endured the wild beating of his heart when Sirius said his name.Remus had had plenty of time to get used to being in love with Sirius Black. It still hurt, not being able to express it, but he had fallen into a comfortable rhythm with him, banter and casual flirting a part of it.Until Sirius, during the summer, had succumbed to ‘crush-phase Remus’ behaviour. Which had made Remus wonder. And oh, how he wondered.“Happy birthday, Moony.” Sirius said, handing over the flowers. He was still smiling shyly.Remus let his hand linger when he accepted the flowers, eyes alight with joy. He could hear Sirius’ breath stutter a little, looking down at their hands before his gaze went to Remus’ lips.Interesting.“Christ, Pads.” James said,getting off the bed and picking a daisy from his hair. “Moony, you gotta stop this ‘cause this idiot sure as hell won’t.” he nodded towards Sirius, who had that same fucking bashful look on his face, now looking down.Remus wanted to kiss him, more than anything.“He’d steal you the freaking Moon, if you’d ask!” James laughed when Peter almost tripped over the flowers, knocking his toe against his nightstand and letting out a howl.Sirius’ smile grew, his eyes going to Remus, who was touching the pedals of the sunflowers. He recognised that look.Excitement and determination.“Padfoot, no-” he started but Sirius had already gone on a tangent on how he could totally do it.James listened, clearly amused, as did Peter, but his eyes darted to Remus every now and then, raising his eyebrows as if to say ‘Are you going to let this idiot actually try and do this?’But when Sirius’ eyes met Remus in the middle of his rant (‘I mean, sure, we wouldn’t have any tides but we don’t even know how to surf, right?’), they were sincere. They held something so sweet, deep and grounding that Remus just had to smile.Sirius mirrored it and Remus was lost in it completely.So what if Sirius was an idiot? He was Remus’ idiot, after all. At least, that’s what he let himself believe.//Sirius had been in a foul mood a whole month. Another month and it would be Remus’ birthday. His last one in Hogwarts.“What the hell’s going on with you?” James had asked at one point, clearly agitated that Sirius’ mood swings carried over to not just lessons but Quidditch practice as well.But Sirius had mumbled some excuse about his brother being a twat and family drama and walked off.At one point, coming down from the Astronomy tower, Remus was just in the middle of telling Sirius that the full moon was after his birthday this year so thankfully they could all get together with the girls and have a nice day in Hogsmeade, when Sirius stopped him.They stood on the staircase, others passing by and Sirius seemed to be waiting until they were alone. He seemed pained.“Imagine if there’d be no moon.” Sirius said to him. He was wringing his hands.Remus stared at him blankly. “Huh?”“With no moon, you’d never have to turn, right?” Sirius asked.Oh, so this was what was bothering him. “Well, yeah, I think? Haven’t really thought about the logistics of it. Does the moon have to be destroyed completely? Will I still turn if it’s stored away in a broom closet?” Remus’ tone was light, trying to diffuse Sirius’ tension.But Sirius shook his head, leaning back against the wall. He looked gorgeous, his fair longer than last year, pale neck on display as he let his head thump back. Remus held onto his books with a vice-like grip.“So unfair, though.” Sirius told him.Remus frowned. “Padfoot, I’m used to it.”Sirius' eyes opened and he put both hands on Remus’ shoulder, stepping in. In the tight space, they were so close, Remus could track the movement of Sirius' throat when he swallowed, the fluttering of his eyelashes. His grey eyes seemed like an autumn storm brewing.“You shouldn’t have to be.” he said, as if he firmly believed in it. Remus believed that he did. But the intensity startled him anyways.He didn’t know what to say, other than draw a parallel in his mind to what Sirius might’ve been projecting. Regulus hadn’t talked to Sirius for the better part of the year and being subjected to abusive parenting was definitely something the Black brothers were both used to - but they shouldn’t have had to be.There was a moment, a truly glorious moment, where Sirius leaned in and Remus thought that he was going to kiss him. He even had time to go through all the stages - excitement, panic, relief, fear, excitement again - when Sirius’ eyes flickered to Remus’ lips for a split second before coming back up to his eyes.Then, another student came hurtling down the Astronomy tower, muttering something about being late to Potions, and the moment was lost.Sirius leaned back, hands falling to his sides in fists to let the student through. He cleared his throat, forcing a smile. “History, right?”Remus nodded, his chest feeling strangely empty.But really, what was he expecting?He opened his eyes to a very familiar sight that year, with all three of his best friends hurdling themselves into bed with him and jumping up and down while singing Happy Birthday.They were significantly bigger than in their first years of Hogwarts, so it wasn’t long until the pillow fight started by James ended with Peter falling flat on the floor, dragging Remus with him as he went.Sirius and James lent over the edge of Remus’ bed, laughing at them. Peter just snuggled up to Remus and said “Happy birthday, Moony.”, looking ever so content.James loudly protested to Peter hogging all of Remus’ cuddles and promptly slid down to the floor as well, snuggling up to Remus on the other side while Remus himself laughed, touched by their sudden burst of clinginess and softness. The older they all got, the more comfortable they got with each other (to be fair, Sirius and James had always shared a bed on many occasions, when Sirius had one of his nightmares), the only exception being Sirius.Sirius, when alone with Remus, would be guarded, yes, but clingy. With others around, that side of him, the one that allowed comfort in Remus’ closeness, was a lot more subtle and tucked away. In complete contrast to how Peter was, for example, craving the other Marauders’ physical touch - his hugs were the best, so Remus wasn’t complaining.Sirius looked down at them, fond, and caught Remus’ eyes. Something flickered there but it was gone before Remus could start dissecting it. Sirius grabbed a blanket and draped it over them, lying down alongside James. “There, all snug and cosy. Is this what we’ll be doing on your last birthday at Hogwarts, Moony? Napping on the surprisingly comfy, albeit disgustingly dirty floor of our dorm?”“The disgusting part is your own fault, Padfoot.” Remus countered but in truth, he wouldn’t have minded such a turnout. More and more he felt his joints ache even when the full moon wasn’t around the corner. His mind was more troubled and besides being hopelessly in love with Sirius, the prospects outside of Hogwarts weren’t exactly welcoming.If he got to spend one of the last days at school with just his friends close, it wouldn’t have been so bad.“I’ll have you know, the candy wrappers are Peter’s.” Sirius retorted, pulling at the blanket.“Oi, stop hogging, you blanket-hogger.” James said, pulling too. He made an ‘oof’ sound when Sirius elbowed him.There was a giggle and a creak of the door. “Glad we’re not interrupting, then?” Lily and Mary came in, bearing gifts.James immediately shot up, looking rather sheepish. Remus rolled his eyes in time with Sirius and they burst into laughter simultaneously.Lily had gifted Remus an early copy of ‘The Hobbit’ (he kept borrowing from Lily, so it was nice that she thought to buy one for himself), while Mary handed over a set of new quills, ink and beautiful parchment with intricate drawings of flowers around the edges. She also provided a set of envelopes. “So you’d not forget to write to all of us, after school,” she said, suddenly teary-eyed.When Remus, with a start, realised Lily was also tearing up, he hugged them both quickly, promising that he would, in fact, write as much as they wished.“Alright, let’s go down, I’m starving!” Sirius announced, leading the way.In the Great Hall, Dorcas and Marlene came over, joining in on another rendition of ‘Happy Birthday’.Remus noted, midway through his eggs and sausage, that everyone around them seemed to fidget in various ways and were acting weird, casting glances at Remus and then Sirius. He raised a brow at Marlene, who had been eyeing Sirius with a weird look as if to say ‘well?’. She shrugged and looked away.Sirius looked exceptionally bothered by it all.Remus tried to brush it off - it didn’t seem like anything he should ask about at the moment and he’d rather enjoy a day with his friends at Hogsmeade in peace rather than in the aftermath of a fight (if that’s what this was about).Exiting the Great Hall, they all went to put some more layers on them against the deceptive spring winds and then met back up at the foyer, ready to go.Walking down the road, Remus enjoyed looking at his surroundings. The grass took a greener shade every day, the sun was warm on his face even though the wind was cutting through his jacket. The lake glistened in the far distance and there were swallows flying right over them towards the dark forest.“I’m just saying, seems a bit anticlimactic doesn’t it?” Remus heard Dorcas whisper to Marlene behind him.He tuned back into his surroundings, when he saw Sirius’ back stiffen in front of him. “Maybe it’s something that we won’t get to see.” Marlene said.Remus frowned, no idea what they were talking about.“Alright, McKinnon, out with it,” Sirius gritted his teeth but when he turned, he was smiling at Marlene, vicious (if maybe sorrowful).Marlene seemed unbothered by getting caught and said, “I’m just saying, we thought you’d be delivering Remus the stars themselves by now.” Mary giggled at this, linking her elbow with Marlene.Sirius’ eyes flashed. The girl had obviously struck a nerve.“So maybe it’s something Sirius is delivering later, away from prying eyes,” Marlene finished, winking.Remus instantly felt his neck warm up and his ears, too. Oh, fucking hell, he thought. Not this again. Marlene and Dorcas had been pestering him about Sirius for the better part of last year.Lily started, “Guys, why don’t we-” but she didn’t get very far because Sirius threw his hands up in frustration, stopping completely so that James bumped right into him.“I couldn’t do it!” He said, dramatically. “I couldn’t deliver this time, I’m sorry, Moony.”And he seemed genuinely upset about this.Remus laughed. He couldn’t help himself, it was just so absurd - Sirius was mad at himself. For not stealing the freaking Moon. Because now Remus remembered their conversation last year. This absurd, wonderful, adorable, beautiful boy, he thought to himself.Sirius' face turned sour and Remus quickly went to correct his error. “Sorry, I just- Sirius, you can’t have expected me to actually think you’d steal the Moon, right? It’s the Moon, Sirius. Moon. I cannot stress enough how impossible that is.”They’d all stopped now and Remus was staring at Sirius with a mix of amusement and disbelief.“Wait, you asked for the Moon? Pretty selfish, don’t you think, Remus? I mean, the rest of the world needs the Moon too, you know.” Dorcas interjected.“Yeah, I was kidding about the stars.” Marlene added, clearly surprised by the turnout of a conversation she herself started.“I didn’t even know you were actually trying,” Remus said, seeing that Sirius was truly upset about this.Sirius wrung his hands, sighing, and looking up to the skies. It looked like he was in pain. “I know how much it would’ve-” he glanced at the girls quickly, and stepped closer to Remus, lowering his voice, “it would’ve meant to you.”Remus couldn’t believe Sirius actually researched how to steal the fucking Moon. He wanted to snog his face off.“Mate, how in the world did you think you could pull it off?” James asked from behind him, completely incredulous, while Peter stared at Sirius like he’d lost his damn mind finally.Sirius’ eyes stayed on Remus as he spoke, carelessly. “Some shrinking spell, obviously. But that would entail getting up into space, or like, getting the Moon closer to me with some sort of summoning spell. Or a powerful enough spell that would actually reach the Moon from here, I guess. It’s bloody difficult when the thing is like billions of miles away.”Remus snorted and was aware it sounded half-hysterical when he said, “You complete moron.”He laughed again, from the bottom of his heart. “You absolute idiot. You’re brilliant.” Remus said then, unable to stop laughing because, God, someone in the universe must have really hated him to give him Sirius Black in his life. Or perhaps really loved him.Because Sirius was a nuisance. And he was so in love with him it was ridiculous.Sirius seemed amused now, too, pocketing his hands. His eyes were still a bit sad, but he smiled, at least. “Thank you? You kind of insulted and complimented me there all at once, but I’ll take it. Sorry, still.”Remus calmed a bit at that, drawing a breath. Vaguely aware that the others were still surrounding them, he said in a moment of sobriety, “You could just steal something else for me.”Sirius squinted at that. “Like what?” he asked, suspicious. “Because I’m pretty sure they already suspect me of stealing in Honeydukes after our last trip…”“No, not what I had in mind,” Remus said, eyes sparkling. Suddenly, he couldn’t care less that he was about to expose everything to Sirius.If he’d ever had doubts before, all of them vanished. Sirius tried to steal the Moon for him. Who else does that, if not a person in love?“You could steal a kiss.” Remus elaborated, casually. He smirked at Sirius, who seemed taken aback.“A kiss?” he said, slowly. “From who?”Remus could hear James snort behind them but paid him no mind. “From me, you idiot. Steal a kiss from me. For me. That’s what I want for my birthday.”Sirius’ eyes widened. To his credit, they never left Remus in order to search James’ for confirmation or Peter’s for encouragement. He just stared at Remus, mouth half-open.Remus gestured with his arms, as if saying ‘Well? Come on then.’ and raised an eyebrow towards him.Sirius' whole demeanour changed. His face lit up like a Christmas tree, a lovely blush creeping up his neck. His hands snaked around Remus’ face and Remus instantly locked his hands around Sirius’ arms to steady himself.“I can do that, definitely.” Sirius replied and Remus only had time to roll his eyes at Sirius’ smugness, before he leaned in.Sirius’ lips were chapped, like they always were - he kept gnawing at them when he thought no one was looking. Even so, they were incredibly soft on Remus’. Sirius kissed him tentatively, a bit unsure, but definitely with a promise for more.Against his lips, Sirius whispered “Happy birthday, Moony.” and Remus smiled.“Shut up, you gorgeous bastard, shut the fuck up.”His right hand went to grab Sirius’ waist while the left went to his jaw, holding him in place while also drawing him in and with one fell sweep of his tongue, he opened Sirius’ lips.Sirius’ gave only a small gasp, to his credit, but it was still there. And then he kissed Remus with such shattering enthusiasm, Remus was ready to just lay him down, right there, in the grass and dirt and everything. Finally, finally.There was a mild cough and a clearing of a throat. Sirius pulled back, annoyed. “Do you mind?” he asked, frustrated at whoever it was he was glaring at over Remus’ shoulder.Lily laughed loudly while Dorcas snorted. “I mean, congratulations and all that but we're still here. Do you want us to go or…?” she asked, amusement tainting her annoyance.“Yes, leave, go away.” Sirius waved a hand at them.A small chuckle escaped Remus’ lips, his head fell to Sirius’ shoulder where he mumbled, “Padfoot, don’t be rude. It is my birthday, we were going to spend it with friends.”“That was before I found out what an exceptional kisser you are.” Sirius lamented.“You say it like it’s a bad thing.”“It is if I have to stop now.”“Hello,” James waved, coming up to them. “Still here.”Sirius actually shoved him, making James burst out laughing.“Guys,” James said, faking sorrow, “We’ve lost him.”“Fuck off,” Sirius replied sweetly.Remus squeezed his waist, the other hand moving to his cheek to get his attention. Sirius’ attention snapped right back to him, eyeing him almost reverently. Remus tried his best not to swoon.“How about,” he said, cherishing the way Sirius leaned into his hand, “we go and have fun with our friends and later, I can show you how exceptionally good I am at other things besides kissing?”Sirius Black hadn’t blushed like that since… well, never. “Fuck me,” he groaned, dragging out the vowels and closing his eyes. “Don’t just say it like that!”“Also, still here,” Peter reminded them.“Sorry,” Remus said, but he didn’t sound sorry at all.Sirius eyed him and relented. “Fine. Fine, I guess we’ll do what you want since you're the birthday boy and all. But I’m holding you to that promise.”“Wasn’t a promise.” Remus smirked.Sirius leaned in, kissing his cheek. Remus did swoon just then, no matter that he was the one doing all the inappropriate flirting. “Promise me?”“I promise, Padfoot.” Remus said, sincere. “All of that and everything else, too. We have time.”Someone else might have been confused by his wording but Sirius wasn’t. He simply nodded and leaned back in, giving Remus another kiss - quick peck on the lips and Remus was already riding on a high he couldn’t come down from even if he wanted to.He didn’t.Sirius slid his hand into Remus’, intertwining their fingers with a gentle squeeze. He gave Remus a blinding smile.“Alright. Blow their minds, Remus Lupin, it’s what you do best.”", "45540085000": "After the fall of Voldemort, everyone seemed to have their own ideas for what to do with the old Black house. It could be turned into an Auror training bunker, Bill Weasley suggested, and the hallway hexes could be used as exercises. His wife, Fleur, disagreed. She wanted 12 Grimmauld Place to be used as a long-term care home for St. Mungo's; the Janus Thickey Ward was terribly overrun with residents these days. Luna Lovegood wondered aloud if it should be turned into a peace garden, with Moonseed and Angel’s Trumpet blossoming from its floors and overgrown Asphodel sprouting above its rooftops. \"It could be nice,\" Neville Longbottom agreed, \"not to mention useful, to house magical ingredients from across the world right here in London.\" If Hermione Granger had her way, surely it would have been converted into a home for free house elves and put in Kreacher’s name. There were even some mumblings about the property remaining a safe house, though no one was sure how that would work exactly.\"No, I don’t think we should do that,\" the hoarse voice of Harry Potter startled the meeting's attendees. \"I mean, any of that. I mean, the house is mine. It’s time I take it back.\"The group of Order and Dumbledore's Army members had been gathering twice a month to discuss war recovery matters - topics that ranged from Hogwarts restoration to upcoming Wizengamot trials to what to do with the Black ancestral home. They weren't accustomed to hearing The Boy Who Lived speak much at these gatherings these days; more accustomed to watching him doze off lightly with his chin in the palm of his hand or walk out to smoke an indiscreet pipe of calming draught. There were stories splashing pictures of Harry with that pipe in every Wizarding World newspaper from The New York Ghost to Le Cri de la Gargouille.\"Well, okay, what do you want to do with the house?\" Ron Weasley asked his friend. The others raised their eyebrows, waiting for a response, uneasy.\"Does it matter? It's my property,\" Harry barked.He could hear Molly Weasley huff loudly in reaction. In all honesty, though no one wanted to address it, she and Harry hadn't been getting along well these last few months, with Molly expressing her concern about his potion use through uncharacteristically passive-aggressive displays of displeasure at what felt like his every move.The Burrow was starting to become unbearable for Harry: Molly with her hovering, Arthur with his looks of disappointment, Ginny with her nonsensical pep talks, Ron and Hermione with their whispers, and George with his retreating footsteps that hesitated to approach Harry at all. He missed Charlie. Sweet, handsome Charlie, who let Harry cry into his shoulder without demanding to know what was wrong or needing to fix it. Charlie, who would distract Harry from the guilt-tripping voices in his own head with an endless barrage of dragon facts. Charlie, who didn't push Harry to use his wand like the others did, didn't patronizingly tell him his broken spells were looking fantastic when his mental blocks pushed him back to the level of a third-year.Charlie was the one who cast his Patronus to watch over Harry as he slept - a Romanian Longhorn dragon who breathed a cast of blue smoke that Harry swore felt like sunlight. And when Harry kissed him, drunk off Beetle Berry Whisky, Charlie only smiled softly and put his hand on his shoulder to stop him from going further so as not to embarrass himself. \"I wish I met you later,\" Charlie whispered, his gentle way of saying it wasn't the right time for that now, not with him. Before he went back to Romania, Harry had begged him not to go. Charlie had hugged Harry tightly and told him to look after himself. He told him not to worry and that he'd find the right man soon. Harry's heart had fluttered at that, feeling grateful to Charlie for knowing him well enough to understand that he wanted love with a man, even though the whole Wizarding World seemed to think he should get back with Ginny.After a tense pause at the Grimmauld meeting, Minerva McGonagall finally broke the silence. \"Are you quite sure?\" she asked Harry before anyone else could speak up, her voice filled with care and concern for her former student as usual. \"Even with the war memories, hexes, history, and Merlin knows what dark magic seeping within those walls, you'd like to keep and presumably live in the property?\"\"Yes, Professor.\" Harry hated how he sounded like a little boy.“Very well,” Minerva replied. “Then, after Auror inspection, we should relinquish the property and assign the wards to you next month.” “No that is a dreadful idea!” Molly screeched. “Molly, dear-” Arthur held her arm lightly. “Sirius would have wanted this,” he told her. And then that was final.So the second of February 1999, 9 months after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry slipped out of the Burrow in the morning without a proper goodbye. He instead left a letter, scrawled in his loopy handwriting with a feather pen.\nDear Arthur, Molly, George, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny,\n\nThank you for treating me like family this year as well as during all my time at Hogwarts. I know I didn’t say it enough but I know I am lucky. I think some time by myself will be good for me but I will miss you all and especially Molly’s cooking. Please don’t worry about me while I am away.\n\nTalk soon,\n\nHarry \nWhen Harry walked back into 12 Grimmauld, he exhaled. The familiar tone of the chime of the grandfather clock in the living room striking five brought him comfort. He plopped himself on a moth-covered velvet settee in the library and drifted asleep. When he woke he felt so much relief in solitude, he almost didn't connect his fireplace to the floo system at all. Ultimately he chose four trusted people from his life to enchant the bricks so only they could call:\n\nMinerva McGonagal\nCharlie Weasley \nDean Thomas \nLuna Lovegood \n\nThen, with a puff of Draught of Peace and a smirk, he added one more:\n\nDraco Malfoy", "45540072999": ["Disciplinary Hearing(Claire Bennet(Hayden Panettiere) from Heroes).", "", "Claire Bennet chewed down on her lip in the most nervous manner possible before turning around the corner. She dressed in her cheerleader uniform when walking up. Her red and white top moved up to show her toned midsection. Her skirt came up a little bit, maybe a couple of inches shoulder than regulation. She had socks pulled up over her feet, and wore a nice pair of shoes.", "She walked over towards the door with the name plate of \"Coach Potter\" on it. She raised her hand and knocked on the door.", "Claire wouldn't lie, she was a bit nervous, and not just because of the fact she was up for this hearing, she had been nursing a little curse on the coach. Every time she saw him, he sent her heart a flutter. Harry Potter was a handsome older man, and Claire had a few dreams which left her with sticky sheets, and a lot of frustration.", "\"Come on.\"", "Claire swung the door open and stepped inside. She walked towards the front desk and saw Harry Potter. He dressed in a nice tank top with his jacket slid off. She drank in the sight of his muscular arms and the shirt fit his body like a shirt. The pair of jeans he wore made Claire wonder what laid underneath. She shook her head.", "'I'm in more than enough trouble as is,' she thought to herself.", "\"You wanted to see me, sir?\" Claire asked.", "\"Yes, Ms. Bennet, please take a seat,\" Harry said. He motioned towards the chair and she sank down on the chair. \"Well, you've turned a few heads lately, haven't you?\"", "\"Um, sir?\" Claire asked.", "\"I'm a bit concerned about the quality of your performance,\" Harry said. He peered over his glasses to give her a searching look. \"Out on the field.\"", "\"You think I'm not showing enough school spirit?\" she asked. \"I thought….I thought I was doing a rather good job.\"", "\"You aren't lacking in school spirit,\" Harry said. He gave her a smile. \"There are other concerns though, the fact you're….directing way too much attention away from the game with your antics.\"", "\"Sir?\" Claire asked in confusion.", "\"I'm referring to your uniform,\" Harry said. \"I'm very well aware how young girls dress, and I understand why some of them have a need for a little skin. And if it acts as motivation to inspire the team, then I won't have any problems with it.\"", "\"I'm….you have a problem with my uniform?\" Claire asked, leaning forward. She placed her palms on his desk and leaned forward. It allowed him the perfect view of the front of her uniform, with her lacy red bra underneath.", "\"Personally, no, but some members of the team, claimed you were being a bit distracting,\" Harry said.", "\"Well, maybe they should keep their eyes on the ball, and not elsewhere,\" Claire said. \"I'm sure you've told them about as much, Coach.\"", "\"I have, and it's their own faults they can't focus properly,\" Harry said. He looked at her with a raised eyebrow. \"Still, there have been a few complaints about the length of your skirt as well, from the staff at this school, and from the parents.\"", "\"Are you saying I'm going to be kicked from the Squad?\" Claire asked. She hitched in a breath and stared Harry down.", "\"I'm just saying you might want to take some time away, perhaps not wear such a short skirt, such a tight top,\" Harry said. \"People can see your panties when you are lifted in the air.\"", "\"Why, were you looking, sir?\" Claire asked. She received a stern look from the coach, prompting a shudder in response. \"Sorry, sir, if I seem so forward, so inappropriate, but….\"", "\"I'm more than willing to speak up in your favor,\" Harry said. Claire swallowed and responded with a nod. \"Providing you do something for me.\"", "\"Please, anything,\" Claire said a moment later. She bent back in the chair, pulling down the skirt. She didn't want to get in any more cover. \"I'll do anything, just…what do you want me to do?\"", "Harry rose up to his feet and walked over to the office door. He clicked it lock in response.", "\"The times you've looked at me has not gone unnoticed, Ms. Bennet,\" Harry told her. \"You've been staring at me, undressing me with your eyes, when you think I'm not looking. And flashing you my panties, and making it out to be an accident.\"", "Claire flinched underneath this particular gaze. She couldn't deny it.", "\"You've frustrated me,\" Harry said. \"Do you think it's easy to remain professional when a hot piece of teenage ass is flaunting herself at me?\"", "\"No, sir…I'm….I didn't mean to cause any trouble,\" Claire said. She looked at him. The stern look on his face caused her to melt and thank herself she was sitting down.", "\"You've frustrated me,\" Harry said. \"And I want to know what you're going to do about that frustration, Ms. Bennet?\"", "Claire looked at him and wondered if he was implying what she thought he was. The handsome older man gave her another look which opened the gateway to the utter ruination of her panties.", "\"Stand up,\" Harry said. \"Let me look at you….don't try and pull your skirt down. You didn't seem have a problem with showing me your panties all season.\"", "Claire dropped her hands to her side. Her skirt came up to reveal her black panties. She wore it a bit short, this skirt actually was the same one she had been wearing since she was on the JV squad, and now, she had shot up a few inches, and her legs had grown longer. The same amount of material had to cover a lot more.", "\"Is that gum?\"", "Claire looked at him with a nod.", "\"Yes, sir,\" Claire said. \"Sorry, when I'm nervous, I need something in my mouth….helps me…..\"", "\"Please, get rid of it,\" Harry said. He held out a trash can before her to spit her gum out. \"I have something more constructive for you to do with that mouth of yours.\"", "Claire wondered what he was going for. The gum was out of her mouth, and Harry pushed his lips onto her mouth, backing her back onto the desk.", "The pretty blonde's breath had been taken completely out of her body. Harry leaned her against his desk and kissed her. Her mouth opened like an obedient little pet, allowing his tongue to slip deeper into her mouth. His tongue mapped out a path on his mouth.", "The kiss lasted maybe a minute in total, but it resulted in the most mind blowing experience Claire ever felt. He released her mouth and Harry stepped back.", "\"I want you to do something to ease my frustration,\" Harry said. He peered down at her, corking one of his eyebrows. \"Do you think you can do that for me, Ms. Bennet.\"", "\"Of course, sir,\" she said, dropping to her knees without a second thought.", "Claire fumbled with his belt, pulling it off. She managed it after a couple of tries and then pulled his pants down. She saw a pair of boxer shorts on the other side. The Cheerleader couldn't help, and lick her lips when she saw the big bulge.", "\"That's all because of me?\" she asked in a little girl voice.", "\"Yes,\" Harry told her. \"You made a mess, what are you going to do about it?\"", "\"Oh, I don't think I'm done making messes yet,\" she said. She grabbed his boxer shorts and pulled them down, freeing the monster inside.", "Harry's cock smacked her on the cheek when it had been freed from its prison. The beautiful blonde wrapped a hand around Harry's tool and pumped him.", "\"I've always wanted to suck this cock,\" Claire said. \"Can I put it in my mouth now, sir?\"", "Harry leaned back and placed a hand on the top of her forehead. He looked into her deep blue eyes and smiled.", "\"I won't stop you,\" Harry said. \"Do it, now.\"", "Claire leaned in, pleased to see his cock was as big as she imagined it. Hell, it might have been even bigger than she imagined it. Her tongue extended forward and started to lick the head, as if giving him a taste test.", "\"You're not helping with the frustration,\" Harry said. \"You said you wanted something in your mouth. Well, I'm offering you something to replace your gum, and I think you can agree it has a much better….taste.\"", "Harry hissed out the last word at the mouth where Claire wrapped her juicy lips around Harry's cock. She took his cock into her mouth and started to bob down onto it.", "Claire took Harry's cock into her mouth. She made sure to taste every single square inch of him. It grew in her mouth and caused her mouth to be completely full. She enjoyed a full mouth, and enjoyed the taste of what he was going to give her.", "\"Do you know how many times I've thought of you doing this?\" Harry asked. She made a few slurping sounds, making several passes. \"Do you know how many times I wanted you to drag you into my office, and force you to suck my cock for being such a tease?\"", "Claire bobbed her mouth down on the older man's cock, and pulled away from him. She gave him a little smirk.", "\"Load, I hope,\" Claire said. She fondled his balls and then pushed his cock back into her mouth for more intense sucking.", "\"Too many to count,\" Harry said, holding onto the back of her head and guiding his naughty little angel. \"As many as I'm sure you dreamed about sucking my huge cock.\"", "Claire nodded, driving her hot mouth around his probing tool. She couldn't really hold back her desires much longer. She blew the older man, taking his massive cock into the depths of her warm mouth.", "\"You're going to get that replacement for that gum,\" Harry said.", "Claire was sure what she was going to get rhymed with gum. Therefore she redoubled her efforts to give Harry's pole a complete going over. The fact he had a position of authority on her which he shamelessly abused made this all the much more exciting.", "Harry rode himself out to an orgasm in Claire's wonderfully, tight mouth. Her lips continued to smack around him, hunger dancing in them when she kept suckling on him.", "\"Good, we're getting really close,\" Harry said. \"You're going to make me cum. I bet you're getting off on that, aren't you?\"", "Claire popped her lips around Harry's throbbing prick and smiled. She kept sucking on him, bringing his cock further into her mouth each time he passed between her lips.", "Harry fired his load into the teenage girl's mouth. She took a huge big load into the mouth. His cock slipped out when she thought he was done, and she received a nice facial of cum. Harry's spunk splattered all over her face.", "\"Now you've got my cum all of your face,\" Harry said. \"That won't do at all…you should clean it off, young lady.\"", "Claire smiled and reached over. Harry grabbed her wrist to stop her.", "\"With your fingers,\" Harry said. \"Wipe it off of your face with your fingers and lick yourself clean.\"", "Claire swiped the thick white fluid off of her face, and shoved those soaked fingers into her mouth. She looked towards Harry, eyes glazed over in passion.", "\"Get on my desk, and spread her legs,\" Harry said.", "\"Do you want me to take my uniform off?\" Claire asked.", "\"No, leave it on,\" Harry said. \"On my desk, please.\"", "Claire turned around and decided to crawl onto the desk facing away from Harry. Her skirt flipped up to show her ass, clad in those lacy panties. Harry slapped her on the ass to cause a whimper before she turned over, laying back on the desk.", "Her skirt rode completely up making sure Harry saw her panties. Claire spread her legs far, showing how flexible she could be, how far she could spread for Harry.", "\"How's this, Coach?\" Claire asked.", "Harry gave her one of those smiles which caused girls to moisten between their thighs. He leaned down and slid her panties back.", "\"Perfect.\"", "Harry leaned down and gave Claire a long and lingering kiss on her lower lips. She hitched in her breath. He sucked away on the outer lips and then moved up to lick her thighs briefly, before swirling his tongue around her.", "He received a good taste test of her dripping hot pussy. It was so tight, she tasted so wonderful. Harry licked her outside and buried his tongue into her, licking her core as much as he could reach.", "\"Mmm, that feels so good, Mr. Potter!\" Claire breathed, grabbing onto the back of his head.", "Harry's handsome face buried underneath her skirt, between her thighs, moistened her center even more. Claire caressed her hands up her fit body, feeling the pleasure from Harry's questing tongue. It kept working its way deeper into her.", "\"I'm sure you enjoy this,\" Harry said. He tasted her a little bit more to encourage Claire to practically cream herself. \"You taste good, like sweet honey.\"", "Harry licked her honey pot a little more. Every time his tongue buried into Claire's body, electricity shot through the cheerleader's body. Her hips bucked and coated Harry's faces with her juices. She held onto the back of his head and kept bucking up.", "\"Keep eating me, please,\" Claire said. Her crush ate her pussy like it was the most divine meal on Earth, showing her how a real man went to work.", "Harry pulled away from her, smiling in response. His throbbing cock had been primed and ready to go. His fingers rubbed Claire's slit and the scorching, wet, heat encouraged Harry to do one thing.", "\"Ready for the main course?\" Harry asked. \"Let's see how flexible you really are.\"", "Claire's pussy was born for this. Her entire body lit up in passion. The older man's hands rested on her cunt, rubbing in.", "\"Please, sir, fuck me,\" Claire said. \"I need you in me….soooo bad!\"", "Harry smiled and straddled her hips for a brief tease. His hard cock brushed against her entrance when he leaned over to kiss the side of her neck.", "\"All you Cheerleaders are the same, so easy.\"", "Harry pulled her shirt back and played with her perky breasts a little bit. His hands skimmed down her body. He paid special attention to her face. The anticipation, the little gasps of pleasure, she really didn't hold back from showing her passion towards him.", "\"So easy.\"", "Claire would have protested for a moment. She couldn't lie to herself or to him. Claire Bennet craved his touch.", "\"Mr. Potter, I'm so wet,\" Claire said. \"Please, fuck me sir.\"", "Harry's cock pushed on the outside of her pussy. The first few inches slipped underneath her skirt and inside her pussy.", "Claire bit down on her lip. She tried to push up, feeling the pain spread through her body when he fully pushed past her barrier inside her body.", "\"Only five inches, and you're already crying like a poor little baby,\" Harry said. \"I must say, I'm disappointed, Ms. Bennet, I know Freshmen who can take more than you can.\"", "Claire closed her eyes and tried to push herself on, ignoring the slight.", "\"It's just so big!\" Claire cried out, unable to believe there was only five of his twelve inches inside of her tight pussy. \"You're breaking my tight virgin pussy, Mr. Potter!\"", "\"I thought you wanted my help,\" Harry said. Her bra had been pulled down and her perky tits, firm and defying gravity stuck out. Her cute little pink nipples stuck out and Harry licked them. \"Didn't you want my help?\"", "\"Yes,\" Claire panted, almost cumming right from the friction of his mouth over her nipple.", "\"Then, you better help me,\" Harry said. \"Don't you want to help me?\"", "Another inch slid into her when Claire thrust her hips up towards him. Her hands cupped his bum when pushing into her.", "\"I want to help you, hard!\" she begged him.", "Claire summoned all of what she could do, spreading her legs as far as possible, so Harry could finishing submerging his rock hard rock inside her body.", "\"Then just relax, and take my cock,\" Harry said.", "Claire relaxed and more of his cock slid inside of her. The pain slowly faded from her, when Harry kissed her neck, her collarbone, and her breasts, every lovely inch of her breasts. Harry pushed into her, sliding into her.", "\"Good girl,\" Harry said to her. \"You want to be a good girl for me, don't you?\"", "\"I can be a very good girl,\" Claire said, biting on her lip. \"OOOH…this feels so good…feels so good…..mmmm….feels good!\"", "Claire made a lot of sounds of content. Harry pushed all the way into her and almost pulled out of her. The tip of his cock rested at her dripping entrance. Claire didn't worry about the sheer length hurting her, she anticipated it. He opened both Claire and her pussy up to new, wonderful experiences.", "\"Sweetie, we've only just began to make you feel good,\" Harry said. He plunged into her. \"You're going to be my own personal cheerleader when this is over…..how would you like that?\"", "Claire would have thought of a snappy retort, but she couldn't.", "\"Give me an O!\" she yelled.", "\"Oh, no problem,\" Harry said.", "The moment Harry said these words, he rammed his cock deep inside Claire's tight pussy and signified the orgasm to end all orgasms. The moment the orgasm hit, Harry pounded her tight little pussy.", "Her moans encouraged Harry to keep up what he was doing. Orgasms chained together in such a rapid fire succession, Claire thought she would lose it.", "Harry pulled himself out of her, and the loss of his cock caused a soft whine to be issued by Claire. She turned around to see Harry leaning back on his elbows, cock pointed in the air. His man pole twitched and beckoned her over.", "\"Let's see if you can take me from a different position.\"", "Claire crawled over him for a moment, pushing her breasts into his face for a little tease. She stroked the older man's chest, running her fingernail down it. A sultry little smile spread over the face of the beautiful blonde cheerleader.", "\"I just love bouncing up and down,\" she said, fluttering her eyelashes at Harry. \"Want me to show you how much spirit I have?\"", "\"I don't think it's the lack of spirit that's a….ahhh….problem.\"", "Claire's wet pussy slid down onto Harry's pole. This time, she took the cock into her with greater ease, more pleasure, than pain. She drove her love box down onto Harry's generous sized fuck stick.", "\"I love cock just as much,\" Claire said. She pounded her pussy with Harry's length. \"We should have been doing this for ages.\"", "\"Yes, we should.\"", "Claire bent down and kissed him. His hands trailed over every inch of her sexy little body. The tight teenage cunt drove itself down ono his cock, tempting him, and teasing him.", "\"Mmm,\" she moaned, slipping a finger into her mouth.", "Harry thought she looked very fuckable in that uniform and was glad she kept it mostly on. He rested his hands on the thighs of the younger girl. He brought her dripping hot cunt down onto his cock, making her rise all the way and lower herself down it.", "\"Good girl, very good,\" Harry groaned. Her tight pussy clamped down onto him. \"You're doing….really good….it feels really good.\"", "\"Feels better to have a nice big cock inside me,\" she said. \"You're making me cum again, sir!\"", "The wet fluids coated Harry's cock to make Claire's descent on him a bit easier. His hands explored her body, worshipping every inch of the cheerleader.", "\"Keep this up, and I might call in a favor, and make you the Head Cheerleader,\" Harry told her with a smile, squeezing her ass.", "\"I wonder why,\" she murmured. \"I'm so close!\"", "Harry steadied the pace and worked into her like a machine. His hips thrust up to meet hers when they came down. They met in a sexual frenzy of energy. Hands felt each other, every single part, their bodies molding together in lust.", "\"Don't hold back,\" Harry said. \"I'm nearly done…\"", "\"Don't pull out of me, please!\" Claire yelled.", "\"I had no intention,\" Harry said. \"You're going to take all of my cum in your body, and like it. Maybe you'll have a little reminder of our little meeting.\"", "Claire grabbed onto his shoulder and encouraged him to keep going into her. She could feel how heavy his balls were. Her body heated up with more thoughts of what might happen should his load spill into her. Intensity spread through their.", "Their loins met in the age old dance of passion. Harry came all the way down into her, her hips sliding pretty much all the way up to meet his hard throbbing cock. Those balls were so full of cum, and soon she would be as well.", "\"Please,\" Claire murmured sexily in his ear. \"Show me how manly you are, those little boys on the field can't compete with you, Coach!\"", "Harry smiled and hammered her pussy even harder, feeling the tension rise in his balls. Her latest orgasm squeezed him, resulting in him losing his load inside her.", "The first warm splash of cum caused Claire's hips to twitch up and ram against his. She thrashed, squeezed, and milked the seed from his aching balls. An immense amount of cum spilled inside her body, coating her womb.", "\"It's so much!\" Claire yelled.", "\"Of course it is, that's how much cum a real man has,\" Harry said. \"And now, I've made you a woman, my woman.\"", "Claire hung onto him and milked his orgasm down to the very last drop. He spilled inside of her.", "The moment Harry finished inside of her, he pulled out of the cheerleader.", "\"So, how was it, honey?\" Harry asked her.", "\"Good,\" Claire said. She sat up and wrapped her arms around Harry, resting her head on his chest. \"So…..are you serious about your office door being always open?\"", "\"Always,\" Harry said. \"If you ever need anything…..\"", "\"I'll march my ass up here,\" Claire said. \"And next time, you can take that too.\"", "", "End.", ""], "45540073000": "", "45540073001": ["Time to Spare(Amy Pond(Karen Gillan) from Doctor Who).", "", "Amelia Pond, better known as Amy to well mostly everyone, reclined on the couch and waited for him to come home.

She dressed in a black skirt to show her nice long legs.", "'Almost time.'", "Harry was never late. He was always on time where he needed to be, and most importantly where he needed to be. And sure enough, he made his way home with a smile on his face. He dropped the case down on the table and walked over towards her.", "\"Busy day?\" Amy asked.", "Harry reached over and pulled her off of the couch, wrapping his arms around her with a smile. The two of them kissed each other with heated passion.", "Amy could only begin to guess how long Harry had been gone when he had went on his little missions. It was less than a day, maybe a couple of days, or a week depending on the period in time he had been shuttled off to, at least on her account. On his account, it would have been much longer.", "The kiss blew her off of her feet and curled her toes. Amy watched when Harry turned her around. She leaped into his arms when he continued the kiss and brought her over towards the couch and set her down smile.", "\"You don't want to know how long it's been,\" Harry said.", "\"Oh, I can guess, just a little bit,\" Amy said. \"But, it's been almost a day for me, and that's way too long….do you think I'll be able to come along with you someday?\"", "\"You're nearly ready,\" Harry said. \"Just keep up with your training….it's not easy.\"", "\"No, it isn't, but for you, I'll spare all of the time in the world to learn,\" Amy said. She could see Harry's eyebrow crinkle up. \"Sorry, love, I won't say the T word when you're off of the clock.\"", "\"Just another rampaging nut job trying to wipe out a timeline,\" Harry said, answering the unasked question.", "Harry sat down on the couch and Amy draped her legs over his lap. Harry smiled when placing his hands on her feet and started to lightly massage them.", "\"Oooh, I missed this,\" Amy said. And she meant it, because the jolts of pleasure coming up through her toes amazed her beyond all wonder. Harry's fingers always had the magic touch.", "\"You can't get enough of it,\" Harry said. \"And I can't get enough of those cute little feet and toes of yours either, along with your beautiful legs…where do they ever end?\"", "Amy smiled when she could feel her soul mate's hands rolling up her legs. She might have lost a little bit in life, but she regained it back. Harry's fingers rolled up the side of her ankle and then back to massaging her foot.", "\"You spoil me way too much,\" Amy said. \"And you're the one traveling for….I don't even want to know how long…and I really hoped you continued your collecting along the way.\"", "Harry smiled when rolling his fingers down the side of her leg.

She shuddered when Harry licked her toes. It felt so good.", "\"Yes,\" Harry said. \"Aren't you glad I found you?\"", "Amy responded with a nod, she was glad she came across Harry in one of his many Adventures in Time, and was persistent in falling him back to his ship.

She took her foot, slick with Harry's salvia and rubbed her big toe against the length of his throbbing cock.", "\"You're so big,\" Amy said. She smiled when brushing those toes against his throbbing hard penis. \"And I love it when it goes between my toes….in my hand….in my mouth….when it's jammed deep in my cunt.\"", "She spoke the word with such elegant sweetness Harry just had to smile Amy stroked him some more with her beautiful toes and smiled. Harry rewarded her actions by rubbing and playing with her legs.", "\"You've been gone for so long, I need to welcome you home in style.\"", "Amy wrapped her feet around Harry's long cock and rubbed them up and down his length. Her slick feet brushed against the throbbing manhood.", "\"Damn, they're so soft, they're so beautiful.\"", "Harry groaned at the sensations of Amy's toes and feet rubbing up against him. His hands explored her gorgeous legs without any abandonment.", "\"Just like you're thick, prick,\" Amy said. \"Are you going to cum over my soft soles? Are you going to cum all over my pretty toes? I painted them red just for you, just the way you like it.\"", "Amy vigorously jerked off Harry with her feet. His hands rewarded her efforts with a massage. Select jolts of magic spiked up through her and struck Amy firmly in her loins. Her pussy vibrated underneath what Harry was doing.", "\"You're so good, you're better than perfect,\" Amy said. She squeezed those feet around the area of Harry's cock.", "\"I can't hold on much longer….\"", "\"Then don't,\" Amy said. \"All this pent up cum…it's not healthy for you love, and I'm always looking out for your best interests.\"", "Amy concluded her foot job and got a nice little reward by having Harry's cum shoot up and splatter all over her feet and her legs.

She sucked them dry with a sultry look in her eyes.", "Amy got on her hands and knees, with her skirt flipping up, showing her panties. Harry smiled when he saw the black panties covering her amazing ass. The powerful young man reached over and cupped his hands over the top of Amy's ass and gave it a tight little squeeze.", "\"I'm going to reacquaint myself with all of my favorite parts.\"", "\"I'm sure you are,\" Amy said.", "Harry flipped up her skirt to further have access to her ass and pulled down her panties. Her soft, pale ass looked rather inviting with a tight little rosebud. Harry placed his face against her cheek and pressed against her asshole, inhaling her lovely scent. His fingers rested on her clit and tongue shoved up her asshole.", "Amy gasped and held onto the couch. Harry's tongue pushed deep into her asshole, and got her nice and wet. Her lubricated back passage dripped from Harry's long term efforts. He brought the tongue further into her tight hole and swiped his tongue through it.", "\"Oooh, Harry,\" Amy breathed at the top of her lungs.", "Harry brushed her clit while munching on her tight ass. Amy's hot body spread with the pulses of her nerve endings. He brushed against her several times while the continued worshipping of her ass continued.

One hand finger brush against her inner slit, the other hand brushed against her pubic hair. She was getting hot and bothered.", "\"No, and….I want you in me,\" Amy said.

Harry placed his cock.", "Every time they were done, Harry reversed time on her body, and took her virginity all over again. And each time, it had been amazing. He brushed the head of his cock against the proof of her innocence.", "Amy's skin boiled the second Harry pushed all the way into her. Her legs wrapped around his thighs and hands pushed against Harry's firm ass. She reached up and pulled off his shirt the rest of the way. His muscular chest came down and pushed against her lovely breasts in response.", "\"Thank you, my husband,\" Amy breathed. Her nails ran down his back when Harry kept bringing his cock deeper inside of her body.", "He pushed down inside of her. Only half of his length spread between her thighs. More went inside of her tight pussy. Amy rubbed up against him, practically purring in his ear, and running her fingers down his back.", "\"Soooo good, honey ,so good,\" Amy said. She nibbled on the side of his earlobe.", "\"I've been waiting a long time for this,\" Harry said. \"I know you've stayed up at night, waiting for me to return, hoping I would take you in your sleep, and take your innocence all over again.\"", "An explosion came from the leggy redhead's loins. She pushed up against Harry's probing penis when it shoved deeper inside her. She wanted more. The cock going hard and fast into the depths of her made Amy lose all of her sense.", "Harry worked her up to an orgasm. He started playing with her legs, marveling at how wet it did. His meat missile sought the intense heat pumping from her.", "\"Go ahead, love, let it go,\" Harry said.", "\"Yes, I'm cumming!\"", "Amy's accent became more pronounced when Harry drove his cock into the tight body of his sultry little vixen. The fiery redhead kept encouraging him to drive more into her. He brought his hips down onto her and plunged deeper into her tightness.", "\"Mmm, you're so good, I love this!\" Amy breathed. She panted when feeling Harry's hips crush down upon hers, never once letting up on his intense thrusting.", "\"Just wait,\" Harry said.", "Harry's strong loins brought themselves down on Amy's body. He pushed against her. The bodies of both of the lovers met in the center with each other.", "Amy's entire body reached an increased state of stimulation. Harry pushed all of the right triggers in her mind and brought her hips further up to meet him. Harry slid out almost all of the way and left the tip of his cock against her lower lips.", "Harry crashed down inside of her, those hips meeting together at a certain point. Amy's fingers pushed against Harry. The continued rocking and grinding of hip on hip action made Amy close her eyes and come closer to losing her mind.", "The latest orgasm slickened the path between her legs. He slid all the way out of her and inside of her. Harry drove down into the tight pussy of his companion, rocking deep inside of her.", "\"Don't hold back, really give me everything you've built up,\" Amy said. \"Breed me, I love you, Harry Potter….put a baby in my womb!\"", "Harry pushed deeper inside of her. Their bodies connected with each other in the never ending, always increasing dance of passion. They rocked up and down on each other. The increased pitch between the two of them reached an end.", "\"You're going to get everything what you wanted, Amelia Pond,\" Harry said.", "Amy's pussy clenched and pushed him deep inside her. She rubbed her legs against his body, while running her hands against his lower back, his ass, everything to keep Harry inside her, and fucking her closely.", "\"Yes, baby, give me one, \"Amy breathed. \"I'm so horny, ohhh, I think I'm in heat!\"", "\"I've noticed.\"", "Harry's full length pushed deeper in between her smoldering thighs. The wetness of her squeezing pussy prompted Harry to rise up almost out of her and push himself deeper inside her body. He worked his hips in and out of her in quicker succession.", "Her tight cunt squeezed Harry's thick, pulsing rod. Amy's breath increased with Harry going deep and far inside her. He jammed his thick cock inside her dripping hot pussy, working into her with a steady flourish of sharp pushes.", "\"Harry, please, I need…..mmmmm.\"", "Harry's balls clenched no sooner than she had been brought to her latest orgasm. The pressure in Harry's balls released and started to spill their contents deeper inside her pussy. Harry groaned when rising almost all the way up out of her and pushing deeper inside of her.", "Amy clenched him hard. Those juices spilled inside her womb as fast and fluid as possible. Harry worked deep inside of her, fertilizing her eggs with his dripping hot cum.", "Harry rammed into her with a few more thrusts. Their hips met together when the contents of Harry's balls drained into her.", "\"Don't stop fucking me until I'm good and pregnant,\" Amy breathed in his ear. \"Please, honey, keep it up, don't stop, please don't stop.\"", "Harry finished injecting his life bringing fluids deep inside of her. He pulled completely out of her and pointed his cock towards her. Their combined juices drained off of it.", "\"It would be a shame,\" Harry said. \"If this went to waste.\"", "Harry lubricated her back entrance with a finger and pushed it inside of her. Amy's eyes closed when Harry's finger pushed into her tight ass.", "\"It would be…a real shame,\" Amy said. \"I need you to fuck me in the ass, more than life itself….please…\"", "Amy recalled how big Harry felt jammed into her ass and also didn't care. Harry took the edge of his prick and inched it closer towards her tight, puckered hole. He eased himself deeper inside her back entrance and moved into her each by inch.", "Both savored the moment. Harry played with those legs and lifted one of them up to start planting little kisses down the back of her leg. He licked her, and caused her to shudder.", "\"You're in there,\" Amy said. \"I can't believe how deep you are.\"", "Harry swirled his tongue around the back of calf and brought his cock in and out of her ass at a steady pace, building up a pleasure.", "Amy's fingers reached down and touched her body. He was getting her so hot, and she couldn't have enough of him. Harry rose almost all the way up and slid deeper inside her body. Every time his balls struck her ass, Amy's pussy jumped up.", "\"Now, you're squirting.\"", "\"That's what you're doing to me, bugger me!\" Amy yelled.", "\"Yes, dear.\"", "Harry pushed himself into her ass. He had to feel up what he was fucking, and her ass was so soft, so warm, so supple. The flesh fit in his hand in the most tender, and amazing way possible.", "His crotch met a certain point on her ass. Amy's breathing increased the more Harry pushed deeper into her. He had her right where he wanted her. His thick cock pushed further into her ass with each push. He kept pushing deeper inside her every second of his hard thrusting.", "\"So, good, this is so good,\" Amy murmured, letting out a pleasured breath.", "Harry would have to agree. He drove her to lustful madness, and his balls were about ready to pop. He rested those hands against her thighs, keeping up with his pushing inside her. Those balls slapped her firm ass one more time.", "So much pleasure, Amy thought she would die from the overstimulation of her body. Harry's hands continued their pleasured worship of her leg while fucking her ass.", "She almost blacked out one more time. A steady ram into her ass woke Amy up before Harry pulled all the way out of her until the tip was in her ass. He drove into her one more time, sending his cock into her warm depths.", "\"I just can't help myself, your ass is so hot,\" Harry said.", "\"Don't worry, I know, but I'm not going to be happy until you put your hot, thick seed in between my buns,\" Amy said. \"Would you do that for me, baby? Would you?\"", "Harry groaned up a yes when penetrating her with another deeper thrust. He rested his hands on her thighs and continued to thrust inside her.", "The molten liquid flooded Amy's taboo hole. He rode her ass all the way to completion, riding her ass to completion. Those balls grew with a little less volume.", "Harry pulled out of her ass after fucking it raw and Amy winced when her ass hit the couch cushions.", "\"Worth every moment.\"", "", "The End.", ""], "45540073002": "", "45540073003": ["Imprints(Caroline Farrell/Echo(Eliza Dushku) from Dollhouse).", "", "The brunette girl leaned back against the wall. The cool surface of the wall brushed against the girl's palms. She dressed in a button up white top which only came up halfway to her midriff. Tanned and toned, an abundance of skin allowed anyone to see it. A red and black plaid skirt came down to the apex of the girl's thighs. Thigh high white stockings adorned her legs. The shoes dangled from her feet when pulling them up and coming down. The attire gave her the impressive over a schoolgirl, but the outfit also made her feet really good and more comfortable.", "Those eyes looked up and waited. Countless fragments rattled the back of her head. The poor girl had an identity crisis, and had been sent to this location to be sorted out by an expert.", "The doors opened up. A handsome dark haired man stepped in front of the captive girl's eyes. A visual undressing followed when looking up and looking back. Brown eyes met these piercing green eyes. The man dressed in a lab coat which opened up. A nice button up shirt followed, with dress pants. The man carried a clipboard and walked towards the patient.", "\"They tell me you were first called Caroline Farrell,\" he said. \"Your official designation is Echo, due to your ability to retain certain aspects of the personalities which have been imprinted on you.\"", "\"Yes,\" she said. \"But, my life is a mix of fragments, so….I'm not sure what I am right now, or what I can be.\"", "\"I'm here to help, my name is Doctor Harry Potter,\" he said. \"I specialize in the therapy of women who have lost their way.\"", "She was in at least a dozen minds to ask more. Harry crooked a finger and convinced the girl to stand up straight. Once again, she smiled. Harry slid off his lab coat and dropped it to the ground. The shirt sleeves came up just enough to see a pair of toned arms.", "\"Well, they said you would come to help me,\" Echo said.", "\"Yes,\" Harry said. \"But, I can't help you, if you don't help me.\"", "The patient in question didn't know what to feel about what he said. All she could do was step forward in front of the young man. His gaze penetrated the young girl. It was almost like he looked into her very soul.", "\"How are you feeling?\" Harry asked.", "\"I….I don't know,\" she admitted.", "Harry motioned for her to come closer to him. He took the girl into his arms. Echo gasped when feeling the young man tighten the embrace around her. They came an inch or so closer together.", "\"I don't know, what to say about this,\" Echo said.", "\"This is a very hands on exercise,\" Harry said. \"If, you're not comfortable, we can try something else. Although, we might not get the same results.\"", "Echo took a moment to close her eyes. A part of her became excited at the possibilities. Several thoughts ran wild at what this Harry Potter was capable of.", "\"No, I need this,\" Echo said.", "The brunette babe didn't know what she wanted. Harry took Echo close in and the two of them met lip to lip. Echo, defensively, started to raise her hands up. Harry only deepened the kiss in response.", "Echo placed her hands on the man's cheek. Instead of shoving him away, she simply dug her nails in closer and kissed Harry deeper. Their warm lips met together in a passionate dance.", "Harry's hands roamed without abandon. Slow at first, but picked up. It encouraged Echo to delve into feelings which she hadn't properly explored in a long time. Feelings which she had not been programmed to explore, unless it served a purpose, but most of the time, the purpose had been artificial.", "This was more real. The kisses continued, and Harry pulled away from her. Salvia dripped from the girl's lips. Another couple of kisses, this time trailing down her jaw line. Echo encouraged Harry to continue with light moans.", "Harry couldn't believe how surprising soft the girl's skin was. He kept kissing her, and bringing passionate plays. The vixen continued to level some breaths until Harry finished off with those kisses directed towards her.", "The activity continued for a bit more. Harry analyzed the look of wanton lust through the girl's eyes. He sparked a fire in her.", "\"The subject appears to have the desired results,\" Harry said. \"But, I want to know, how are you feeling now?\"", "\"Wet,\" Echo said. \"And really horny.\"", "Echo's skirt rolled up to show Harry a pair of lacy red panties. She gripped the waistband and snapped the panties against her flesh. The panties showed the outline of her lips.", "\"I can see,\" Harry said.", "A blink of an eye resulted in her panties wiggled down closer. Harry brushed against her navel which resulted in a gasp. He pushed down and reached her.", "\"Make sure you tell me everything you feel,\" Harry said.", "Echo parted her thighs for intrusion. Harry pushed one finger into her depths. The warmth spread apart Harry at each pump. The flesh contracted around him.", "\"It feels so good,\" Echo breathed. \"I can't have enough, I want even more.\"", "The dark haired girl wiggled her hips up towards the doctor. The medical examination continued when Harry pushed a finger inside of her. He leaned in and gave her a kiss. Echo anticipated these kisses.", "Harry touched his lips against her warm lips while playing tribute to another set of lips. He rubbed Echo's pussy and clinched her around the clit. Echo leaked juices down on him.", "Echo reached around, to feel up on Harry just as she did. Her hand stopped at a very prominent bulge which was growing. Echo reached in his pants and squeezed it.", "\"Oh, you're excited as I am, aren't you, Doctor Potter?\" Echo asked. \"Why, don't I return the flavor from earlier? Make you feel as good as you made you feel?\"", "\"Now, Ms. Farrell, this is out of the scope of our examination.\"", "Harry knew this would make her want him and his cock any more. Echo descended to her knees and pulled Harry's pants down with practiced ease. His thick, cock sprung out for her.", "\"Don't worry,\" Echo said. \"I won't tell anyone, this will be between you, and me.\"", "Succulent red lips surrounded Harry's manhood. Echo got a good grip on the young man's backside. Passionate brown eyes met Harry's with the sucking.", "\"This makes you want to put my cock into your mouth, doesn't it?\" Harry asked. \"I wonder if we'll be exploring other areas tonight.\"", "Echo intended to explore other areas. A clenched hand weighed Harry's balls. She enjoyed the immense weight those balls filled and knew from shattered memories it would taste really good once she emptied them. But, did she want this load down her throat? Or did Echo save it for later?", "Harry flickered through Echo's silky dark hair. The doll rose up and brought more of Harry's engorged manhood into her mouth. Harry was very pleased how she was being cultivated, being liberated enough to want to serve only one person.", "\"Just be honest with your feelings,\" Harry said.", "Echo lavished Harry's cock with more spit than she thought anyone could ever imagine. The manhood left her mouth only to lick around it before popping it inside. Echo wanted to spend a lot of time sucking on it. She didn't really want Harry to lose it just yet.", "Harry fastened a tighter grin on the back of Echo's head. The young man pushed into the mouth of the cock-sucking goddess. Echo grabbed Harry and took as much cock as any one woman could manage. It was pure sexual lust with how much she went down on him.", "\"Mmm,\" Echo breathed.", "\"Keep doing what you feel is right,\" Harry encouraged her.", "Echo pulled away from him. The brunette rose up to her feet and balanced on the bed in the medical area. The brunette positioned on her hands and knees when showing Harry a delicious dripping slit. Harry smiled and approached the woman.", "\"Oh, there's something burning in me, and I don't know what could cure it.\"", "The doll shamelessly shoved three fingers inside herself. The juices collected upon the fingering. Echo explored her depths before retracting the fingers from within.", "\"That didn't help at all,\" Echo said. \"Doctor, I don't know what we should do. Surely, you have something that can cure my burning….passionate….desire!\"", "Echo swatted her backside with a solid spank. The sound of hand against flesh made Harry grow hard.", "\"There's one thing,\" Harry said. \"The process of injection might hurt at first. But, don't worry. Just hang on and you're going to feel wonderful.\"", "Harry positioned himself behind Echo. The mirror on the wall showed the anticipation dancing in the girl's eyes. Harry lined his hard cock up at Echo's entrance. He gripped the girl's hips and positioned closer to the other side. Harry groaned when sliding into her.", "The tightness of her pussy was like pure magic around him. Harry slid into her. Echo's passionate moans followed. Harry slid into her and out of her.", "Echo grabbed onto the bed. Harry split her apart, and Echo could not get any more. Her mind was more clear now than ever before. Harry gave her one singular focus, how great this sex was. The never thrusting set Echo's motor cunning.", "\"You're right!\" she screamed. \"It feels good.\"", "\"See, your doctor knows best,\" Harry said. \"And you feel really good as well.\"", "Echo was sure he was the perfect fit for her. Every time the handsome doctor filled Echo up, new pleasure coursed through the doll's body. The front of her top ripped open and Harry cupped the woman's free breasts. The hands squeezing her glorious flesh made Echo increase in excitement.", "Harry guided Echo to one of the most potent orgasms possible. The thrusts started at a slow and steady beat. Echo's moans increased when Harry's thrusts increased. He paused to feel up the girl's body.", "\"More, please, harder!\" Echo yelled.", "Harry tightened the grip and plowed into the dark haired girl. Echo's head snapped to look into the mirror. Harry could see the woman's passion increase. Harry reared back and plowed the doll again and again.", "\"Yes, this is my purpose!\" Echo yelled. \"To be plowed, by your thick, massive…cock….I bet you leave all of the girls screaming, begging for more, don't you?\"", "The emerald-eyed gentleman simply grinned at the words of the beautiful woman he plowed. Echo started a bit reluctant, but the more Harry buried into her, the more she craved everything Harry could give. Harry could give a whole lot. Every inch buried into Echo. Thick balls full of cum.", "Echo wrapped around the bed while feeling Harry pounding inside from behind. Every inch of that massive rod sent fire spreading through her. The doll's nipples grew rock hard and she became hard.", "\"So, that's what you are,\" Harry said. \"You were born to be fucked by me. Are you cumming for me often?\"", "\"Yes,\" Echo said.", "Thrust, thrust, thrust, Harry pounded the brunette. He decided now Echo was ensnared to move in for another kill. A twist of Echo's hard nipples caused the woman to scream and cream. Another twist followed by more rapid fire thrusts on the part of Harry.", "\"Would you like to cum more often?\" Harry asked.", "\"Yes,\" Echo begged him. \"I didn't know this…could feel so good. I hope this won't be our only session.\"", "\"Oh, don't worry, we've just begun,\" Harry said.", "Harry stimulated Echo's nerve endings all at the same time. The flare shot through the body.", "\"What do you want?\" Harry asked. \"What do you really want? Tell me your greatest desires, and we can make them happen.\"", "Echo looked pretty cute when chewing down on her lip while deep in thought. Harry slowed down the thrusts to give Echo some breathing room.", "\"I want you to watch me bounce on your big fat cock,\" Echo said. \"Please let me…I bet it's bigger when I'm top. You should really see my face when it enters me…you know for science.\"", "Harry teased Echo with a few more thrusts and reached underneath to touch the girl's clit. He pulled out of her and smiled.", "\"Turn around, and let's do this….no, crawl for me slowly, savor the moment.\"", "Echo dropped to her hands and knees and crawled towards Harry. The throbbing cock stood up and it looked much bigger than it felt inside. Echo walked over and teased Harry, and herself with a few kisses. The warm kisses caught Harry on the rod, and took his head into her mouth. Echo slowly took more of Harry into her, and hummed, very lightly.", "Harry motioned for Echo to climb onto his hips to straddle. Echo did so. The warmth and softness of her flesh made Harry hunger for more. All twelve inches positioned towards the beauty's entrance. The dripping pink pussy lips intended to gobble up every inch of Harry's cock.", "A soft moan erupted when Echo came down onto Harry. She bottomed up on Harry's cock. Her tanned thighs pressed up against his when rising and falling up and down.", "Harry enjoyed the feel of the soft, tight, flesh squeezing around his pulsing member. Echo settled into a rhythm while bouncing up and down. More of Harry worked into the sexually starved brunette. Red fingernails raked Harry's shoulder with a hum cumming out of the mouth of the goddess.", "\"Just take your time,\" Harry said. \"Savor the moment. Savor life's pleasures.\"", "Echo savored every single inch of this particular pleasure. The girl's momentum increased every time when Harry brought her deep into her body. Echo increased with passion and pleasure. The panting female rose and fell. Every time Harry shoved into her, sparks of excitement spread over the beautiful girl's body.", "Harry touched every single savory inch of the brunette's beautiful body. Echo came almost all the way up and slid more of Harry's thick tool inside. She rose up and came down with a couple of long thrusts. Echo slapped down onto Harry with a couple of long, and hungry thrusts. Harry reached in and gripped the girl by the ass to encourage more steady bouncing.", "\"I'm feeling a release,\" Echo said. \"It feels so good….please, don't stop, make me cum hard.\"", "Harry smiled and took further control. Hands rested on Echo's sweaty lower back. The brunette rebounded up and dropped down Harry. Each and every thrust made her feel good.", "\"Who do you belong to, now?\" Harry asked.", "\"You,\" Echo said. \"Because, you're the only one who can make me feel this good, so fucking good. I don't think I can…..mmmm….yeah!\"", "Echo crashed down onto Harry and brought more of the thick aching tool into her. The walls of the woman closed down and milked away at Harry. Harry responded by holding the bouncing breasts. More caresses came through and more tingles came down the spine.", "Harry indulged into this body. Those juices trickled down Harry's pole and allowed the thrusting up to be even harder. Harry kept rocking down into Harry, burying inside her.", "\"Yes, more, I need more, please,\" Echo moaned.", "Harry smiled and nibbled the side of the girl's neck. Echo's passions became completely unbridled. Harry switched the side of the year, tasting the very sweet flesh.", "\"You'll have more for me every day,\" Harry said. \"We'll do this every day, if you're just to come with me.\"", "The double meaning of Harry's works broke something in Echo. A clenching went through the doll's body. Head to toe experienced a burning pleasure. Harry put his hands on her back and encouraged Echo to go down deeper, further. More aching cock spread between Echo's dripping thighs. Harry bounced into the goddess on top of him.", "\"Yes, I'll come with you anytime!\" Echo yelled.", "Harry knew he could count on this. A squeeze of Echo's hips increased the girl's frantic bouncing on top of him. The girl built up even more tension which was going to be released pretty soon.", "Echo never really felt anything better than what was going through her body now. Every single thrust brought new levels of passion. Sweat coursed over the girl's body. The sex crazed vixen kept riding Harry and took as much of him inside as possible. A part of her feared once the pleasure stopped, there would be trouble.", "Harry brushed down Echo's back to encourage the girl from riding up. Overall, everything went as planned. The beauty bouncing up and down him caused a twitch to go through Harry. Harry smiled and explored the front of the girl's body. She bounced even higher.", "\"You know how to make me feel the best,\" Echo panted.", "\"We're almost there,\" Harry said. \"You've been very helpful at helping me, help you.\"", "Echo increased the help all the way through another powerful orgasm. Those slick thighs came down onto Harry. A couple of long thrusts brought increased passion.", "\"I'm going to cum inside you, but you can't stop yourself, can you?\" Harry asked.", "A small part of Echo whispered to pull away. A larger, more vocal part told her to keep riding on top of Harry. The throbbing iron pole pierced the woman deeper into the sexy woman. She craved what lingered between those balls. The balls Echo felt brush her thighs every time when coming down. The girl knew what they held. Burning lust exploded.", "\"You crave something more tangible for your life,\" Harry said. \"And you're going to get my cum, and that will complete this session.\"", "Echo wanted to drag out the thrusting, but didn't back off. All she could do was bounce up and down faster and faster with those thrusts. She craved so much cum. All of it would be inside now. The cum would flood from those thick balls and pump her until Echo couldn't take any more.", "\"Yes…mmmm…YES!\" Echo breathed.", "Harry made sure to meet Echo. The tip of Harry's cock pressed against the womb of the body. The sorcerer prepared to seed Echo, and give her a permanent roll in his life.", "\"Caroline, I need you to cum one more time.\"", "Echo smashed those warm hips down onto Harry. A few more thrusts came down closer onto Harry while bouncing high, up and down. She slapped those hips down onto Harry's throbbing manhood and kept up with the thrusts.", "Harry spent some time familiarizing himself with the skin one more time. Echo thrust down onto him. The tight squeeze of an orgasm well-earned brought pleasure all the way through her. Harry planted himself into Echo and started to plant the first rushes of seed into her.", "Echo's desires had been fulfilled with something warm and sticky exploding into her. She drove down onto Harry with a couple of thrusts and milked the thrusting organ to completion.", "\"Give it all to me ,don't hold out!\" Echo begged.", "Echo intended to get her money's worth, scratching Harry's chest. She drove down onto Harry's hips and gave a passionate kiss to the handsome man while getting cum pumped between her thighs.", "The completion of Harry's orgasm lasted for several minutes. The sorcerer pumped Echo full of his semen and made her his for a very long time.", "Harry pulled out of her and left the girl smiling after completed.", "\"So, do you want me to help you take care of the guards?\" Echo asked.", "\"Do you think you can do so in your state?\" Harry asked.", "\"Yes,\" Echo said. \"And thank you for coming back for me.\"", "The two exchanged a kiss. Both of them pulled away all too briefly, having plenty of work to get done.", "", "End.", ""], "45540073004": "", "45540043000": "July 18, 1997\n\nOften, Sirius felt like a caged animal.\n\nBeing a fugitive wasn’t nearly as fun in practice as it had been in his mind when he was still in Azkaban and had considered running away. Back then, he had imagined great adventures; finding Peter and avenging James and Lily, leaving England and traveling around the world… Voldemort coming back to life had changed his plans.\n\nNo, his plans had changed before that. Meeting Harry and reconnecting with Remus had changed his plans.\n\nSo there he was, a prisoner in his childhood home, doomed to share drinks and faded childhood memories with whoever was kind enough to stop by while he waited for the Order to tell him it was safe to leave. Not many people did, not that he could fault them. The house was depressing, and the portraits downright heinous.\n\nRemus was the one that came the most, along with Tonks who hadn’t left his side since he had stopped pushing her away.\n\nSurprisingly, Hermione had come too. She had gone straight to the library, and Sirius had been too happy to have another human in the house to be offended. He had teased her about being so serious with her studies, had made her blush by insisting she would have been perfect for Remus, had they met as fellow students, then had almost fallen off his chair when he had seen what book she was reading. The shock of finding young, sweet Hermione Granger with a book on dark magic had been nothing compared to his reaction after seeing the note Harry had found in the cave he had visited with Dumbledore.\n\nThe note signed with the same signature Sirius had seen on every letter his brother had sent him almost two decades ago.\n\nThe note that proved there had been more to his brother than Sirius had ever known. \n\nOf course, Sirius had said nothing. Hermione had talked, desperate to find support in an adult, and he had listened.\n\nRemus had found him in Regulus’ bedroom long after the little witch was gone. Sirius couldn’t remember what he had said. There had been tears and screams, but the details were blurry in his mind. Only the results of that evening were clear. Sirius knew what he had to do and Remus was firmly against the idea.\n\nIt took Sirius almost a week to find the book he was looking for and another four days to find all the ingredients he would need. At the back of his mind, a little voice that sounded suspiciously like Remus’ told him it was a bad idea. Sirius had never been good at listening.\n\nFollowing the instructions of the grimoire, Sirius cut his finger and pressed on it to push blood out, letting it fall on the diary he had found in his brother’s room as he recited the incantation. The red liquid merged into the red leather cover, anchoring him to his brother. A part of Sirius’ body merging with a part of his brother’s mind.\n\nHe was breathless by the time he reached the end of the incantation, his magic leaving his body in powerful waves as it worked to bend the flow of time.\n\nBlood was stronger than water.\n\nWith a loud \n\npop\n\n, Sirius disappeared.\n\nOctober 12, 1979\n\nAdmittedly, Sirius hadn’t thought much about what he would do when he would arrive in the past. He hadn’t thought the sound of his arrival to be so loud, or that his brother would be wary of someone appearing in front of him when he was so close to the cave Kreacher had almost died in.\n\nBefore he could shake off the nausea that had settled in his stomach, his brother grabbed his wand. Being thrown to the ground did nothing to help Sirius’ discomfort.\n\n“Who sends you?” Regulus asked as he pressed his wand against Sirius’ throat, not recognizing him.\n\nSirius almost didn’t recognize Regulus, either. In the nineteen years that had passed since his graduation, Sirius had forgotten all the small details that made Regulus’ face. The fact that his brother looked so much like Sirius himself had looked at eighteen almost broke his heart.\n\nHis eyes were a little rounder, his lips a little fuller and he wore his hair shorter than Sirius ever had, but there was no denying the resemblance.\n\nFor a second, Sirius wondered what Regulus could see. If he could see the boy that had turned his back on him and their family under the lines time and misery had carved on his face. If he could see the bits of himself Sirius knew were here.\n\n“Nice seeing you too, Reggie,” he greeted, hiding the wave of emotions threatening to swallow him behind a wry smile and the nickname he had given him when they were still young enough for the shortening of an ancestral name to feel like the height of rebellion.\n\nThe nickname made Regulus’ eyes widen almost comically. It lasted only a second before the boy narrowed his eyes again as he studied him. Sirius could see the moment he understood — to what extent, Sirius didn’t know.\n\n“What the hell?”\n\nShock, with an underlying tone of anger and frustration. Sirius could handle that.\n\n“I’m here to help,” he offered.\n\nRegulus’ laugh was cruel, but Sirius knew he deserved it.\n\n“Last time I saw you, you told me you couldn’t wait to spend the rest of your life without ever seeing me or my family of evil scum again.”\n\nSirius cringed at the words, and even more so at the fact that Regulus had remembered the words so precisely. Sirius himself couldn't remember the conversation, but he didn’t doubt the truth in his brother’s words. He had been cruel in his youth. Cruel and stupid, if this was the kind of thing he had said to his seventeen-year-old brother. He told him so.\n\n“What changed, then?” Regulus asked, his wand still directed at Sirius’ throat.\n\n“I grew up,” was all Sirius said.\n\nHe didn’t say he regretted the way he had treated him.\n\nHe didn’t say sorry for all the things he had said about him in school, and had kept saying long after his death.\n\nHe didn’t say he had forgiven him for siding with their parents at the young age of ten and following in their footsteps after that.\n\nHe didn’t say he missed him.\n\nHe didn’t say he didn’t want him to die alone in a creepy cave.\n\n“Clearly,” Regulus drawled before putting his wand back in its holster.\n\nJust like that, the brothers were walking side by side to the cave. Hermione’s recollection of Harry’s words had not prepared Sirius for the feeling of pure wrongness that went through him when he entered the place. The darkness was somehow denser than normal darkness, the only source of light being their wand, and a green halo coming from the middle of the lake Sirius knew to be infested with Inferi.\n\nSirius should have known it was a bad idea.\n\nRegulus was too adamant about doing the right thing, doing the hardest parts himself despite Sirius warning him that the potion would cause excruciating pain. Just like Sirius had never been good at listening to Remus’ advice, Regulus had never been good at listening to Sirius.\n\nHis screams attracted the Inferi, forcing Sirius to turn his back to his brother to cast the strongest \n\nIncendios\n\n he could muster. For every Inferius that burned, two new Inferi appeared. Sirius retreated, planning on grabbing his brother and calling Kreacher to apparate them out, but Regulus wasn’t there anymore.\n\nWhen Sirius finally found him, the boy was approaching the water on the other side of the island, crawling and moaning in pain but still moving. Sirius ran.\n\nThe Inferi were faster.\n\nRegulus didn’t even register what was happening before he touched the water, the cold waking him up from the trance the pain had put him in.\n\nThe last thing Sirius saw was his eyes, filled with fear as he turned his head towards him in a tentative to cry for help.\n\nSirius screamed. The red light of his spells illuminated the cave as he tried to reach his baby brother.\n\nHis anchor disappeared.\n\nSo did Sirius.\n\nJuly 18, 1997\n\nSirius wasn’t sure how and when he had arrived in Remus’ arms. His tears were running down his face, his body was convulsing as he painfully tried to explain what had happened. It was messy, loud, and filled with emotions Sirius didn’t even think himself capable of feeling, all the things Remus hated, but his friend stayed. He held him, soothed him.\n\n“You did everything you could,” Remus assured eventually, his voice thick with emotion. “Don’t blame yourself, not after everything you did.”\n\n“How can I not blame myself? He was there, Moony! Right in front of me. I watched them take him and I couldn’t do anything.\n\n“I just forgave him and I didn’t even get to tell him.”\n\n“Then you have to forgive yourself, too.”\n\nBehind them, in front of the grimoire still open on the floor, Regulus’ diary covered in red leather had turned into a pile of ashes, a physical manifestation of Sirius’ failure.\n\nSirius wasn’t sure he could ever forgive himself for that.", "45540037000": "She peeked inside the room as the door was slightly ajar. After spending a week away to spend time with her family in Scotland, there were little chores around the house that she is yet to complete and she really didn’t want Kreacher doing much these days. The children are toddlers now, Marlene wanted them to learn how to clean after themselves. Regulus came just about an hour ago, he looked a bit worse for wear but then again Marlene had seen him this way many times, taking advantage of the time that the children are away to double up on doing his job at the ministry. Afterall, in spite of the current peace they’re all experiencing, there’s still a threat out there.The squeals and yells of glee from the twins brought a smile upon her pretty face. They missed their father a lot, only being able to communicate with them through mirrors and such during their week away. Regulus carried both to bed telling them he had bought them a new edition of the popular children’s book that the two probably has memorized by now. Yet they were all excited at the idea of their father reading to them. Both already clad in their pajamas and ready for bed, Regulus held both as he placed himself in the middle of one of the beds and started reading *The Warlock’s Hairy Heart*. She left them that way and went on with her organizing and unpacking their things, albeit with the use of magic yet still needing the focus for it.After everything seem to be in order, she decided to check on the twin’s room again, thinking maybe Regulus needs help in putting both to sleep. As she peeked this time, he saw all three with their eyes closed, the book laid open in Regulus’ lap. She leaned by the door’s sill. Taking in the peaceful scene in front of her eyes. She didn’t know how she arrived at this exact moment but Marlene felt an overwhelming feeling of happiness. Everything she wants and desires in a life is inside this room.She will lay her life for them, her own little family. Having the twins was certainly not something they had planned nor something she expected, but it was the best thing that every happened to her. No amount of fame or glory can ever compare to the happiness that she felt upon seeing their faces. Her first world cup championship title wouldn’t even compare because the first thoughts she had when they won was how proud her children will be of her in the future. They’re her world and she knows they are Regulus’ too.Her chest felt so full of love and happiness and she looked at Regulus, studying his sleeping profile from afar. She knows his face in every angle, knows the little planes and valleys of every inch. They had been in this long enough that every little thing about him is just familiar. She loves him with every fiber of her being. This person who she didn’t even know will be this huge part of her life and yet she was thankful. There were multiple times where she had found herself thinking she was in love with him, but never really said anything nor done anything about it. The thing is she didn’t have to, because there are times, she just simply loves him as the father of her children.It was the kind of love that was gentle as a breeze. A whisper in the quiet of the night. The kind of love where you find yourself between the planes of waking up and falling asleep. The subtle feeling of peace in your heart. There was no longing, of wanting, of demanding, just the feeling of love and the beauty of it. It was like a shadow inside her being, a soul that didn’t need to be acknowledged nor returned. It was pure and giving, like a real love should be. She smiled to herself. They are her life and she will do anything to protect them from anything and everything. Walking quietly like a cat, she took the book and set it by the side table, putting a blanket on the sleeping figures. They looked like angels and her heart sang for their beauty, her little family.", "45540016000": "“Guys. I found an old map.” Remus said and sat down in the library.\n \n“Map?

And you won’t find the treasure without it…” the guy said and was ready to leave but Sirius grabbed his wrist.\n \n“Not so fast pretty boy. I want to make a deal-“ Sirius smiled.\n \n“What kind of a deal…?” Got the boy’s attention.\n \n“You and the book come with us to find the treasure.” James explained and smiled too.\n \n“Exactly.” Sirius confirmed.\n \n“Hmmmm….. interesting…. But no thank you.” The boy said and freed his wrist from Sirius.\n \n“\nWHAT?” \n All four yelled.\n \n“Can we buy the book then—?” Peter tried.\n \n“No.” Simple answer came from the boy.\n \n“Yea you are coming with us.” Sirius said and started to drag the boy to their car.\n \n“Wait Sirius Isn’t this kidnapping-?” Peter tried but everyone else already followed Sirius and the boy.\n \n“Or dear….”\n \nAll Peter though before running after them.\n \n                _______________\n \n“So you have the book with you?” Sirius asked.\n \n“No..” \n \n“Okay them we gonna go visit your place real quick.” \n \n“Where do you live?”\n \n“54 mainstreet.” \n \n“Okay okay… Remus?” \n \n“Yea got it.” Remus said from the front seat of the car.\n \nAt the guys place?\n \n“Here it is-“ the guy said and took it from his bookcase.\n \n“Wonderful!” Sirius said and grabbed it from him. \n \n“Now pack up we leaving in five minutes.” James smiled.\n \nThey sat down at the pretty boys table and looked at the books.\n \n“Yea pretty match” Remus stated.\n \nAfter pretty boy was done they went to pack at the marauders flat.\n \n“How long are we gonna be out?” James asked.\n \n“I don’t know man…? One week two weeks-?” Peter mumbled.\n \n“Just pack something we can buy new clothes there.” Sirius yelled from the other room. \n \n“Okay!” James yelled back.\n \nRemus was already done and was sitting with pretty boy.\n \n“Soo.. what’s your name what do we call you?” He asked.\n \n“Barty.” Pretty boy spat.\n \n“Barty who-“\n \n“Bartemius \"Barty\" Crouch Junior.” Barty cut him.\n \nRemus tried not to laugh.\n \n“\nBartemius?” \nHe said holding his laugh.\n \n“Yes so don’t fucking laugh or I’m gonna burn the fucking books in front of you.”\n \nAnd Remus was silent.", "45539973999": ["Marlene Mckinnon decided in second year that she hated Dorcas Medowes.

Je me suis tournée vers mes amis, pour leur rappeler :- OK, à partir de maintenant, Sam Tyler est « Le Maître ».- Alisone, où sommes-nous ? questionna Lit'. Et, comment s'appelle la femme du Maître, d'ailleurs ?Le Maître en question se mit à réfléchir.Encore et encore.Un long moment.Lit' lui jeta un regard noir, en comprenant :- Tu ne connais pas le nom de ta femme ?!- Non, mais... Techniquement, nous avons eu un mariage politique, c'est tout. C'était pour bien me faire voir par le pays et gagner les élections.Lit' me dévisagea, en raillant :- Really, Ali ? C'est un gars comme ça que tu protèges ?J'ai levé les yeux au ciel, en répondant :- Sa femme s'appelle Lucy. Lucy Saxon.Après ça, nous avançâmes le long du corridor, pour arriver devant une double porte en bois. De l'autre côté, nous pouvions entendre de la musique résonner dans la pièce. Une musique que je reconnus parfaitement :\n « I can't decide,Whether you should live or die,Oh, you'll probably go to heaven,Please don't hang your head and cry,No wonder why,My heart feels dead inside,It's cold and hard and petrified,Lock the doors and close the blinds,We're going for a ride ! » \n\n . \n- Ohhhh shiiiit... murmura le Maître, à côté de moi.- Prêt ? demandais-je.- Non...- OK. Allons-y !\n.\nJ'ai ouvert les portes, et la musique résonna plus fortement encore de l'autre côté. Le Maître était à ma droite et Lit' à ma gauche.Par contre, devant nous, plusieurs personnes nous dévisageaient étrangement. D'abord, il avait une grande blonde portant une somptueuse robe rouge, qui semblait complètement amorphe. Aussi, une jeune fille et sa maman, vêtues de vêtements de servantes, et puis, dans un coin, assit sur un fauteuil roulant, un très très très vieil homme au regard triste.Je sentis Lit' trembler, lorsqu'il demanda derechef :- Nom de Dieu, Ali, où sommes-nous ?!J'ai toussoté, avant d'avouer, le cœur battant la chamade :- Nous sommes en 2007, sur un héliporteur, dans le ciel au-dessus de l'Angleterre, à bord du vaisseau « The Valiant ».\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n Now : \nLe Maître est, comme le Docteur, un Seigneur du Temps, venant de la belle planète de Gallifrey, détruite et perdue dans la Dernière Guerre du Temps.En grandissant, il fut d'ailleurs proche et ami avec le Docteur.À l'âge de 8 ans, les enfants de Gallifrey furent envoyés pour une initiation qui consistait à regarder dans le Schisme Intempéré : Un trou dans le tissu de la réalité, montrant le Vortex Temporel. Bien sûr, ils pouvaient refuser, partir en courant, essayer quelques secondes, ou même le faire pour de vrai.Le Docteur a fait ce qu'il savait faire de mieux : courir.Mais, le Maître, il a regardé.Il a regardé, encore et encore.Longtemps.Bien trop longtemps.Le Schisme lui a envoyé un son dans la tête : Quatre battements.Un, deux, trois, quatre. Pause. Un, deux, trois, quatre. Pause.Sans discontinuer.Les sons incessants des tambours dans son esprit ont eu raison de sa santé mentale. Il plongea ainsi dans la folie la plus profonde. Et y plongea plus profondément chaque jour.Les tambours étant le signe avant-coureur de la guerre, le Maître décida de la conquérir.De devenir le Conquérant des Mondes et de tout l'Univers.Si le Docteur a volé un Tardis pendant la Dernière Guerre du Temps pour s'enfuir de Gallifrey lorsque la planète se perdit sous les lasers des Daleks, le Maître vola un Tardis avant cette même Dernière Guerre du Temps. Pour ne pas se faire rattraper par les Anciens de Gallifrey, il décida de se déguiser, de changer sa personne et de devenir Humain grâce à l'Arche Caméléon de son Tardis, cachant sa vie de Seigneur du Temps dans une montre à gousset.Puis, il s'est échappé à la Fin de l'Univers, à l'an 100 billions, sur la planète Malcassario, sous le nom de « Professeur YANA ». Le Docteur est arrivé sur cette planète, et Martha Jones a réveillé les souvenirs du Maître, qui a ouvert la montre...Le Maître a volé le Tardis du Docteur, qui dans une dernière tentative inespérée a bloqué les Sauts Temporels entre l'an 100 billions et 2006. Le Maître ne pouvant aller que dans ces deux seules Lignes Temporelles, a capturé les survivants de Malcassario, ceux qui rêvaient d'aller sur Utopia, pour les changer en robots Toclafanes. Ensuite, il est devenu Harold Saxon sur Terre, concourant aux élections de Premier Ministre, épousant Lucy pour se faire bien voir et gagner le cœur des Anglais. Ce qui fonctionna parfaitement, puisqu'il remporta les élections. Son but seul était de nuire au Docteur, de détruire ses amis et sa planète préférée.Le Maître était devenu vindicatif.Cruel. Arrogant. Assoiffé de pouvoir.Narcissique. Misanthrope. Machiavélique et mégalomane.Des « qualités » qui pouvaient s'appliquer à Serpentard, qui est d'ailleurs ma Maison. Celle que j'ai toujours aimée et celle dans laquelle le Choixpeau m'a toujours envoyé.\n(Voyez-vous ça...)\nSi les gens apercevaient le Maître comme l'ennemi du Docteur et le Super-Vilain de l'Univers, pour moi, il n'était qu'un enfant abusé, un fou mal-aimé et incompris.Comme moi.Et, comme moi, sa première et vraie maison lui manquait éperdument.Gallifrey.Une magnifique planète, au ciel brun et orange, avec la citadelle au loin, entièrement protégée d’un grand dôme, qui scintillait sous les deux soleils du Système. Au-delà, serpentaient les montagnes, de longues pentes d’herbe rouge intense couverte de neige. Le second soleil se levait au Sud, sur les montagnes toutes dorées. Les feuilles des arbres étaient argentées, et lorsque le soleil les enveloppés le matin, tout ressemblait à une forêt en feu. Et à l’automne, il soufflait une douce brise sur les branches...Une beauté perdue.Néanmoins, pour lutter contre la haine, il ne faut pas encore plus de haine.Même les pardons répétés du Docteur ne purent guérir les cœurs noirs du Maître.Le mien étant brisé, et aimant éperdument les esprits torturés par la vie (Oswald, Peter, Blaine, Kylo Ren, Draco Malefoy, etc, etc, etc.) il m'était impossible de ne pas succomber au bon que je pouvais voir dans les yeux sombres du Maître...Ne vous méprenez pas, le 10e Docteur est mon préféré. Il m'a sauvé la vie en 2012, sans lui je serais probablement morte ou détruite par une autre personne.Ten m'a aidé, m'a sauvé, m'a redonné goût à la vie et à l'aventure. Il était ce dont j'avais besoin en 2012, dans un Monde horrible où j'étais prisonnière.Littéralement.Ten m'a permis de m'enfuir à bord de son Tardis, de découvrir les galaxies et de voyager parmi les étoiles.Puis, j'ai grandi, évolué et j'ai aimé de plus en plus les gens torturés.J'ai été la première surprise lorsque mon petit cœur d'artichaut a commencé à battre pour le Maître. Car, en Janvier 2023, j'ai décidé de me refaire les Doctor Who avec Ten, puisqu'il allait revenir en 14 ! (Spoilers !) Et pourtant, il y a des épisodes que je ne PEUX PAS regarder (« Midnight » par exemple...) et, j'étais stressé de revoir les épisodes avec le Maître, car je ne voulais PAS revoir Ten se faire humilier et torturer par lui. Cependant, je les ai revus. Non pas avec mes yeux de 2012, mais avec mes yeux de 2023. Des yeux qui ont vécu et qui ont changé.Et c'est à ce moment-là, que j'ai pu réellement voir le Maître...Rien n'était prévu et je ne m'y attendais pas...Oups.\n.\nReprenons l'histoire, à bord du vaisseau « The Valiant »...\n..\n\n.\nLa musique s'arrêta, Dieu merci, et un silence pesant enveloppa la grande salle. Enfin, ce ne fut pas silencieux pour tout le monde, parce que, juste à côté de moi, le Maître se mit à hurler en planquant ses mains sur son crâne, tout en plaidant :- Oh, Alisone ! Alisone ! Les tambours sont revenus ! Non, non, non, j'entends les tambours dans ma tête ! Non !!!Merde...Tant qu'il était Sam Tyler, il n'avait pas les sons dans son esprit, mais maintenant...Les personnes à bord du vaisseau nous observèrent étrangement, entre incompréhension et inquiétude. Pendant que j'essayais de soutenir le Maître pour ne pas qu'il tombe de douleur sur le sol, je me suis tournée vers Lit', pour lui dire :- OK, le plan commence maintenant. Lit', prend Lucy avec toi et part libérer le Captain Jack Harkness. Lucy te guidera dans le dédale bordélique du Valiant.Lit' murmura à mon oreille :- C'est laquelle Lucy ?Je souris jusqu'aux oreilles, en révélant :- La belle blonde avec la robe rouge...- Oh...Oui, « oh », parce que Lit' avait quelques soucis concernant les robes rouges...Mon ami se dirigea lentement vers la jeune femme, qui était toujours aussi amorphe. Lit' posa une main timide sur son bras, pour la tirer vers la sortie, en la rassurant :- Hello, Lucy. Mon nom est Lit'. Viens avec moi, nous allons libérer un ami...Un air effrayé traversa les yeux de Lucy, qui chuchota à Lit', plus apeurée que jamais :- Ne me laisse pas seule avec le Maître...Lit' la sortit de la grande salle, en répondant :- Oh, ne t'inquiète pas, je doute qu'Alisone te laisse l'approcher, de toute façon...Il avait raison !\n.\nOK, une bonne chose de faite.Maintenant, la suite !J'ai tiré le Maître vers moi, qui était toujours en proie à ses migraines atroces, je le soutenais par ma main droite, tandis que j'utilisai ma main gauche pour la glisser à l'intérieur de sa veste noire. Je n'eus pas à fouiller longtemps, mes doigts trouvèrent rapidement ce que je cherchai : Son Tournevis Laser.L'objet n'était pas comme celui du Docteur, puisque le Docteur avait un Tournevis Sonic et non Laser.Le Tournevis avait cependant presque la même taille, mais il était argent et doré, avec trois petits tubes en son bout qui pouvaient diffuser une couleur orangée. Puis, me souvenant d'une chose, j'ai donné le Tournevis au Maître, qui avait encore du mal à survivre aux sons.- Maître, je ne peux pas l'utiliser. Tu te souviens ? « Contrôle Isomorphique » ! Y'a que toi qui peux t'en servir.Il attrapa son gadget.- Ah oui, c'est vrai. Tu veux que je fasse quoi avec ça ?J'ai soufflé, avant de dire, avec sérieux :- Ramène le Docteur. Dé-vieillit-le.Le Maître me jeta un regard implorant, en me rappelant à voix basse :- Ali, si je fais ça, il va probablement m'attaquer et...- Ne t'inquiète pas.J'ai souri, je l'ai attrapé par sa veste pour le tirer vers moi et lui voler un long baiser, puis je me suis tournée vers la grande table de la salle.La pièce en question était immense, sur deux étages avec quelques marches d'escalier visibles devant nous qui menaient au second niveau. Tout était en bois, mais contenant beaucoup de gadgets technologiques. Les hublots du vaisseau donnaient directement vue sur le ciel nuageux au-dessus de Londres.J'ai marché vers les deux femmes en tenues de servantes pour me présenter :- Hello Tish, Hello Francine. Je m'appelle Alisone et je vous relève de vos fonctions. Vous pouvez retrouver Mr Clive Jones et quitter le Valiant dès que possible.Malheureusement, la maman de Martha, Francine Jones, me dévisagea avec un très mauvais regard noir, en crachant avec colère :- Pas avant d'avoir tué le Maître...Le Maître en question se tenait debout devant le vieil homme en fauteuil roulant, le Laser devant lui, prêt à renverser l'effet de vieillissement du Docteur.J'ai retourné mon attention vers la dame déguisée en servante, pour lui dire :- Madame Jones, personne ne tuera le Maître.D'ailleurs, ce dernier utilisa enfin son Laser sur le Docteur qui se mit à hurler au fur et à mesure que le dé-vieillissement s'accomplissait. Cela me fendit le cœur, mais il devait néanmoins revenir à son état normal. Et, une fois terminé, le Docteur récupéra toute sa prestance.Il était grand, plus grand que le Maître, plus mince aussi, très très fin. Il avait de profonds yeux marron, de hauts cheveux châtains qui partaient dans tous les sens et il portait un magnifique costume brun, avec une cravate bleu marine et une chemise blanche. Toujours, en toute occasion, il avait une paire de Converses blanches aux pieds.Je souris en retrouvant le Docteur.Puis, je me suis très vite souvenue de la situation dans laquelle je me trouvais.\n.\nPar reflex, je me suis jetée devant le Maître, en levant les mains en l'air en signe de reddition. Il fit de même, dans mon dos. Un peu apeurée, j'ai plaidé :- OK, Docteur... Hum... Il te faut seulement détruire le Paradoxe à l'intérieur du Tardis. Cela effacera toute l'année 2017, celle où le Maître a régné sur Terre. Le Temps reviendra en 2006, quelques minutes avant que les Toclafanes apparaissent. Ensuite... Hum... Well... Après ça... Hum... Eh bien...Le Maître plissa des yeux dans ma direction, en comprenant :- Tu n'as pas de plan, tu inventes des escapades au fur et à mesure !- Yep. Mais je le fais brillamment, n'est-ce pas ?!Il sourit néanmoins.Et, pendant un bref instant, j'ai (encore) oublié que nous étions dans la merde.Le Docteur s'approcha de moi, glissa ses mains dans les poches de son pantalon, et gronda gentiment :- Alisone, combien de fois je t'ai dit de ne pas utiliser tes pouvoirs pour des Sauts Temporels ? Ça créait des Paradoxes !- Well... En réalité, comme nous sommes en 2007, c'est la première fois que tu me le dis...Je souris jusqu'aux oreilles, oubliant le bordel que j'avais foutu dans le Temps, puis le Docteur remarqua :- La façon dont tu récites ton plan au fur et à mesure, j'en conclus que tu sais déjà ce qu'il va se passer, n'est-ce pas ?J'ai baissé mes mains, en avouant :- Ouais... Mais, je veux changer la fin...J'ai jeté un coup d’œil au Maître, désormais à ma gauche, qui ne comprenait pas ce que je sous-entendais. J'ai repris, néanmoins :- Je sais que tu pardonneras le Maître... Seulement, j'avais espéré que, au lieu de l'enfermer dans ton Tardis pour veiller sur lui, eh bien, je pourrais m'en charger... Pas l'enfermer dans le Tardis, je veux dire : veiller sur lui.Le Docteur me reluqua des pieds à la tête. Je pouvais presque voir les rouages de son cerveau bouger dans tous les sens, réfléchissant à quelque chose. Puis, finalement, il dit :- Où est mon Tournevis Sonic ?J'ai sursauté.- Oh ! Yes ! C'est vrai !Encore une fois, je me suis tournée vers le Maître pour glisser ma main gauche dans les poches externes de sa veste, cette fois, et ce dernier maugréa :- Alisone, arrête de me fouiller ! Si tu veux des trucs, dis-le-moi !- Et manquer une occasion de te peloter ? Nope !Je souris en récupérant le Sonic du Docteur et je le lui rendis dans la seconde.Une fois son gadget en main, le Docteur fit ce qu'il savait faire de mieux : courir.Il courut jusqu'au Tardis pour détruire le Paradoxe.\n.\n\n.\nJe souris au Maître, heureuse que mes plans foireux fonctionnent enfin. En attendant le retour du Docteur, j'ai parlé aux quelques Gardes du corps armés qui se trouvaient aussi dans la grande salle, leur disant à leur tour de prendre congé et de quitter le Valiant. Étrangement, je me rendis compte que la famille Jones était toujours dans un coin, rongeant leur frein.- Tish ? Madame Jones ? Vous pouvez partir !- Pas avant d'avoir tué le Maître... répéta la maman.Je m'apprêtais à répliquer, lorsque le Docteur revint dans la salle, en hurlant :- Accrochez-vous à n'importe quoi ! Le Temps va se renverser !Le Maître me prit par la main et me tira vers les rambardes des marches pour nous permettre de nous y accrocher de toutes nos forces.Quelques secondes plus tard, le vaisseau bougea dans tous les sens, de la même façon que tremblait le Tardis lorsqu'elle boudait sous les commandes du Docteur. Un tourbillon comme une tornade entra dans la grande salle, soulevant des centaines de papiers et de dossiers, dont les feuilles s'envolèrent autour de nous. Le soleil et la lune se levèrent et se couchèrent 365 fois en une minute à peine. L'année 2007 s'effaça et nous étions de retour en 2006, quelques jours après l’élection d'Harold Saxon en tant que Premier Ministre d'Angleterre, mais deux minutes avant l'arrivée des Toclafanes.Une fois le Paradoxe effacé, le Docteur se releva en sautant de joie.- Yes ! Tout est rentré dans l'ordre ! L'année 2007 n'a jamais existé pour les Humains sur Terre !Néanmoins, la maman Jones garda son visage sévère et fermé, en demandant :- Alors pourquoi nous nous en souvenons ? Je me rappelle très bien des atrocités perpétrées par le Maître !Je répondis rapidement :- Parce que nous étions dans l’œil du cyclone.- Exactement... avoua le Docteur, en se rapprochant de moi avec suspicion. Alisone, où étais-tu durant ces dernières années ? Les Lignes Temporelles et tout le reste ? Et avec qui ?Je me suis mise à réfléchir :- Hum... Well, je vivais à Laytown, en Irlande, en 2020 lorsque j'ai sauté à Port-Royal et à Tortuga en 1720 pour sauver Lit'. Puis re-2020, avec Peter, qui m'a dit que nous avions changé la Ligne Temporelle sans le faire exprès. Donc, re-Port-Royal avec Lit' et Peter, ensuite la Isla Nublar en 2015. Lit' est resté six ans au 16e siècle pour sauver beaucoup de gens. Ensuite Westeros, pour sauver Jaime et Cersei. Peter et moi à Londres en 2023, dans une Dimension Parallèle et puis... J'ai reçu un message de 1973, de Manchester, où j'ai récupéré Sam Ty..., je veux dire, le Maître. J'ai laissé Peter et j'ai ramené le Maître et Lit' directement ici.Au fur et à mesure que j'exposai ma liste, le visage du Docteur se décomposa. Jusqu'à qu'il se mette à s'écrier :- Pas étonnant que les Lignes soient en pagaille ! Tu passes ton temps à sauver des gens qui sont censés mourir dans un Temps Fixe ! Tu détruis les Cosmic Events !Le Maître leva les yeux au ciel, en rappelant :- Oh, come on, Docteur ! Tu passes ton temps à voyager partout pour sauver les Mondes et aider les gens ! Pourquoi Alisone ne pourrait-elle pas faire pareil, hein ? Jalousie ?Il sourit. Tandis que le Docteur s'approcha de nous, le visage toujours aussi sévère, en murmurant presque :- Toi... Tu n'es pas entièrement le Maître, pas vrai ? Je sens quelque chose d'autre... Et, toi, Alisone...Il sortit son Tournevis Sonic de son costume pour le biper devant moi. La lumière bleue illumina ma silhouette, de haut en bas. Le bruit du Sonic couvrit à peine les murmures du Docteur :- Ah... Je crois... Oui... Intéressant... Impossible...J'ai jeté un regard interrogateur vers le Maître, qui haussa les épaules, ne comprenant pas non plus la situation.Le Sonic s'arrêta et le Docteur s'écrit :- Oh, yes ! J'en étais sûr ! Je me disais aussi que j'entendais trois battements cardiaques !J'étouffai un rire :- Sans vouloir t’offenser, tu te trompes. Je suis Humaine et je n'ai qu'un seul cœur !\n.\nJ'allais répliquer lorsque le Captain Jack Harkness débarqua en trombe dans la grande salle, suivit par Lit' qui tenait Lucy par la main. Juste derrière eux, le papa Jones arriva à son tour pour courir vers sa famille et les prendre dans ses bras.Je souris malgré moi, heureuse de cette joyeuse fin.Du moins, quelques secondes à peine, jusqu'à ce que Jack Harkness ne sorte des menottes de la poche de son vieux pantalon sale et déchiré, pour se diriger rapidement vers le Maître, à mes côtés.Rapidement, j'ai levé mes mains en l'air en me jetant devant le Maître, et m'écriant :- Woaw ! Jack, on se calme !Malgré son visage sale et couvert de poussière, j’aperçus facilement un air interrogateur se dessiner sur ses traits fins, lorsqu'il questionna :- Alisone ? Qu'est-ce que tu fiches ici ? Et, pourquoi tu protèges le Maître ?!Le Docteur se dirigea vers lui et... De quoi ? Le Docteur se pencha vers Jack pour lui chuchoter quelque chose à l'oreille. Quelque chose que je ne pus entendre. Je me suis tournée vers le Maître, toujours aussi perdu que moi.Même Lit' resta dans un coin, tenant Lucy par la main. La pauvre femme était toujours amorphe et apeurée, son visage inexpressif. Seule la peur pouvait se lire dans ses yeux clairs.Jack donna les menottes au Docteur et ce dernier les glissa dans la poche de sa veste.Lorsque, soudain, dans le silence de la grande salle, un coup de feu retentit.\n.\n\n.\nJ'ai sursauté et mon regard s'est porté sur le tireur devant moi. Mr Clive Jones tenait toujours le revolver fumant, sans bouger, entouré de sa famille et surtout de sa femme au regard encore sévère et belliqueux.Mon cœur rata un battement.Je me suis retournée pour faire face au Maître, devant moi, dont une tache rouge commençait à s'étaler sur le blanc immaculé de sa chemise.- Non... murmurais-je.Je me suis jetée sur le Maître, qui tomba malheureusement au sol. Au-dessus de lui, les larmes aux yeux, je balbutiai :- Non, non, non, je suis désolée ! Normalement, c'était Lucy qui devait te tirer dessus ! C'est pour ça que... Non !Le Docteur s'approcha de moi, lentement, et me dit avec peine :- Alisone... Cela signifie que la mort du Maître est un point fixe dans le Temps.Je lui ai jeté un regard noir, avant de reporter mon attention sur le Maître, qui commençait déjà à partir, à mourir dans mes bras. Il tendit sa main vers mon visage, en souriant et révélant :- Ça va aller, Alisone...Mes larmes coulèrent le long de mes joues, puis j'ai posé mes mains sur la plaie sanguinolente. Regardez-moi bien, parce que je me fiche éperdument des Cosmic Events !Je me suis concentrée, j'ai fermé mes yeux et j'ai jeté mon sort :- Gréot gecumen lecan. Gecumen gé drý wæter !- Alisone ! hurla le Docteur dans mon dos. Tu ne peux pas... !- Bebiede þe arisan ealdu. Forbærne yfel !Une lueur chaude, dorée et diffuse sortit de mes mains pour envelopper le Maître, qui avait désormais les yeux fermés. Après de longues secondes de concentration, j'ai laissé ma Magie opérer et mes larmes tomber sur mes doigts tremblants.Je n'entendais plus rien derrière moi, je n'étais plus sur le Valiant, je n'écoutais pas les cris du Docteur dans mon dos, la seule chose importante était sous mes yeux.Lorsque mes sortilèges se dissipèrent, la blessure par balle disparut et le Maître rouvrit les yeux en grand. Ses deux cœurs se remirent à battre et il me sourit en essayant de se relever, avec difficulté.Je l'aidai dans son élan.\n.\nUne fois debout, tenant le Maître à bout de bras, j'ai enfin tourné ma tête vers la grande salle pour apercevoir toutes les personnes présentes me dévisager avec inquiétude et choc. Dieu merci, je remarquai que Jack Harkness avait récupéré l'arme des mains de Mr Jones.Tant mieux !Le plus perturbant pour moi fut sûrement l'air affolé qui traversait les yeux marron du Docteur. Il semblait comme à bout de souffle, tandis que la pauvre Lucy pleurait dans les bras de Lit'. Elle ne pleurait pas parce que le Maître avait failli mourir, mais parce qu'il n'était pas mort.Le Docteur se rapprocha de moi, tout en jetant des coups d’œils vers le Maître, puis murmura avec tourment :- Alisone... Tu viens d'empêcher un Seigneur du Temps de se régénérer avec ta Magie... C'est impossible ! Tu as changé un Cosmic Event ! Ta Magie... C'est impossible ! Ce n'est pas ta Magie qui a guéri le Maître ! Non, bien sûr...Le Maître en question tiqua, en raillant :- Si ce n'est pas elle, c'est qui, hein ? Certainement pas toi !Le Docteur souffla et se tourna vers les autres personnes. Tel le génie incontesté qu'il était, il annonça, presque comme un ordre :- Le Tardis est en état de marche. Je vais tous vous ramener sur Terre. La famille Jones rejoindra Martha. Le Captain Jack Harkness rejoindra son équipe de Torchwood. Quant à Lucy...Il se rapprocha de la jeune femme, toujours apathique :- Lucy, vous pouvez rentrer chez vous ou rester avec Lit'. Ce choix vous appartient. Le Maître n'a plus aucune emprise sur vous, d'accord ?Elle fit simplement « oui » de la tête en esquissant une espèce de sourire. Mon ami Lit' sourit pour elle, en la prenant dans ses bras.Le Docteur n'avait rien dit concernant le Maître et moi.Mais, je savais très bien qu'il avait une idée derrière la tête.Pour l'heure, nous l'avons suivi jusqu'au Tardis.Et, pendant qu'il ramena tout le monde sur Terre, je préparai mon discours dans mon esprit...\n..\nJ'aimais le bruit du Tardis, lorsqu'elle décollait et atterrissait. Mon cœur débordait de joie en revenant dans le vaisseau bleu. Revoir le poste de commande, marcher à nouveau sur le grillage au sol, toucher les fausses racines qui décoraient la salle de contrôle. Tout cela m'avait manqué et j'étais heureuse de retourner dans cet antre magique. Le Maître souriait de me voir sourire.Pendant que le Docteur ramenait les gens au fur et à mesure chez eux, que Lit' et Lucy restaient dans leur coin, loin du Maître et moi, nous, nous étions également dans notre coin, à chuchoter.Il faisait bon dehors, le ciel de Londres ensoleillait toute la population et le Docteur parla longuement avec les survivants. Le Maître et moi restions à bord du Tardis, attendant patiemment de faire breveter notre idée.La personnalité de Sam disparaissait du corps du Maître. Enfin, pas toute sa personnalité, il gardait quelques qualités venant de Sam Tyler. En revanche, sa folie réapparut et parfois, je sentais son âme partir, assailli par le son des tambours dans son crâne. Il était d'ailleurs en proie à une énième migraine à cause des bruits internes, lorsque le Docteur revint à l'intérieur du Tardis.Comme d'ordinaire, son hyperactivité s'empara de lui, il ferma la porte derrière lui, jeta son long manteau sur les racines décoratives, puis il vint de placer en face du Maître et moi.- OK ! Maintenant, retour à vous !- Docteur ? commençais-je. Je pense avoir une idée pour...Néanmoins, le Docteur ne m'écouta pas. Il sortit son Tournevis Sonic de la poche de sa veste pour, derechef, le pointer sur moi et faire biper son gadget avec cette particulière lumière bleue sur mon corps, de haut en bas.Intrigué, Lit' se dirigea vers moi, faisant attention à bien rester devant Lucy pour ne pas qu'elle se sente mal près du Maître.- Docteur ?! repris-je. Arrête avec ton Sonic, nom de Dieu !Il lut les données sur le Tournevis, puis il le rangea rapidement en me regardant étrangement.Impatient, le Maître leva les yeux au ciel, en maugréant :- Qu'est-ce que tu comptes faire de nous ? De moi ?Le Docteur souffla.Il glissa les mains dans les poches de son pantalon, puis il prit une profonde inspiration comme pour annoncer quelque chose d'horrible.Même Lit' me zieuta du coin de l’œil, me demandant par télépathie ce que tout cela signifiait. J'ai seulement haussé les épaules, ne sachant pas.\n.\nÉventuellement, le Docteur parla enfin :- Alisone...- … Oui ?- J'aimerais te poser une question assez... Étrange et Personnelle. Well, en réalité, je pense déjà connaître la réponse, mais, juste au cas où...Visiblement intimidé, le Docteur se frotta le crâne, mettant la pagaille dans ses hauts cheveux châtain. Puis, il prit des pincettes pour demander :- OK... Hum... Alisone ? Est-ce que... Le Maître et toi... Vous avez... Tu sais...Je plissai des yeux tandis que le Maître s'exclama, offensé :- Bloody Hell, Docteur ! Quel genre de pervers es-tu devenu ?!Le Docteur leva les yeux au plafond en soufflant, avant de répliquer :- Répondez juste à la question et je vous expliquerai !Mais, ni le Maître, ni moi ne prononçâmes la moindre réponse.Ce fut donc mon ami Lit', très intrigué et curieux, qui annonça :- Ouais, ils l'ont fait. Hier. Enfin, hier en 1973 quoi.- LIT' ! hurlais-je.Tom apparut devant mon ami, avec un nouveau pot de pop-corn bien chaud, il s'assit sur la chaise de commande, en exposant :- Oh yes ! Encore des révélations croustillantes ! J'adore cette série de merde !Lit' souffla.Le Docteur se frotta le visage, avant de reprendre :- J'en étais sûr. Je ne fais pas d'erreur et mon Sonic non plus. Ce n'est pas toi, ou du moins pas que toi qui as guéri le Maître. Et, j'ai bien entendu trois battements cardiaques venant de toi...Le Maître et moi, nous nous sommes regardés avec incompréhension, cherchant le sens caché de ce nouveau mystère.- De quoi ?! demandâmes le Maître et moi de concert.Lit' leva les yeux en l'air, avant de balancer, passablement impatient :- Mon Dieu, ce que tu as du mal à piger des trucs évidents, Ali ! Le Docteur essaye de te faire comprendre que tu es enceinte ! Bloody Hell ! La Magie de ton bébé s'est mélangée à la tienne, et il entend trois battements cardiaques parce que tu as un cœur, de toute évidence, et ton bébé en a deux ! Comme les Seigneurs du Temps ! Le Maître étant un Seigneur du Temps. C'est bon ?Le Docteur sourit en fit un clin d’œil à Lit' :- Je suis content de voir que quelqu'un suit. Ils sont un peu lents d'esprit, tu ne trouves pas ?- M'en parle pas, ils comprennent vite, mais faut leur expliquer longtemps.Lit' secoua la tête, en signe de désespoir, tandis que je glissai ma main dans celle du Maître. Je faisais les gros yeux, sous le choc et je découvris que mon chéri se trouvait dans le même état catatonique que moi.Tom hurla de joie, en sautant de sa chaise :- Énorme ! Un futur bébé psychopathe ! Ça va être amusant !Lit' lui jeta un regard noir, mais Tom rajouta :- Oh, et, 5 Gallions d'Or que ça sera sûrement des jumeaux.Il engloutit avidement un poignée de pop-corn, tandis que Lit' souffla :- Je n'ai TOUJOURS PAS de monnaie de Sorcier ! Je n'ai même pas de monnaie TOUT COURT ! Et, nom de Dieu, ça ne peut PAS être des jumeaux ! Le Docteur a entendu trois battements cardiaques : celui d'Alisone, son petit cœur d'artichaut, et les deux de son bébé. Les Seigneurs du Temps ont deux cœurs !Tom reprit du pop-corn, puis répliqua la bouche pleine :- Et ? Alisone s'est tapé le Maître lorsqu'il était Sam Tyler, donc Humain. Donc, si ça se trouve, le rejeton sera Humain. Le pauvre... Être Humain avec des parents comme eux... 10 Mornilles que le gosse termine à la DDASS dans sa première année !Lit' se pinça l'arête du nez.- Ça va ? J'te dérange pas ? râlais-je contre mon ami.Lit' sourit jusqu'aux oreilles.\n..\nLe Docteur se frotta derechef les cheveux, les ébouriffant encore plus.Puis, avant qu'il ne prenne une décision que tout le monde allait regretter, surtout le Maître et moi, j'ai annoncé mon plan. (De merde. Parce que mes plans sont toujours foireux, on ne va pas se mentir, hein...)- Hum... Docteur ? Je pensais Jumper dans une autre Ligne Temporelle avec mes amis, et...- Alisone ! commença à couper ce dernier. Je viens de te dire que...- ET, j'aimerais te remercier pour ton aide d'aujourd'hui, en usant de ma Magie pour que tu puisses retrouver Rose...Le sourire du Docteur disparut d'un seul coup.Il me dévisagea un long moment, puis baissa les yeux pour ne pas que je puisse voir ses pupilles briller de larmes. Avant qu'il ne proteste, j'ai repris :- Docteur, le Tardis ne peut pas voyager à travers les Dimensions, mais ma Magie le peut. J'aimerais donc ouvrir un portail pour le Tardis et toi, et vous permettre de rejoindre Rose.Le Docteur releva la tête et m'observa un long moment. Il inspira profondément, avant de dire :- Je ne peux pas accepter...- Si. Bien sûr que tu le peux. Tu as juste peur, et...- En échange, je dois simplement te laisser partir avec le Maître ? Je ne crois pas que...Le Maître en question leva les yeux au plafond et railla :- Oh Docteur ! Arrête de réfléchir autant comme ça ! Alisone t'offre une chance d'être heureux, accepte cette chance ! Comme tu me l'as déjà dit : nous sommes les deux seuls Seigneurs du Temps encore vivants. Alors vivons nos vies ! Rejoignons chacun celle que nous aimons. Retrouve Rose. Si, dans un autre Univers il y a une femme assez folle pour t'aimer, alors rejoint-là !Le Docteur esquissa un sourire.Puis, il frotta son visage entre ses mains, réfléchissant encore à trois millions de choses en même temps. Il tourna son regard vers Lit' et Lucy pour nous dire, au Maître et à moi :- Et vos amis ? Vous en faite quoi ?- Ils vont venir avec nous, bien sûr ! m'écriais-je.Lit' se rapprocha de moi pour me révéler, un peu penaud :- Hum... Alisone, juste une chose... Lucy est morte de peur, elle ne pourra jamais voyager avec ce crétin de... Enfin, je veux dire, avec ton Maître.Il marquait un point.Je me suis tournée vers le Maître en question, qui commençait à s'ennuyer, puis je lui ai dit :- OK, je pense que ça serait plus facile si tu commençais par t'excuser auprès de Lucy...Il esquissa une mine dégoûtée, en raillant :- Pourquoi ? Pour quoi devrais-je m'excuser ?Lit' s'énerva et vint se poster devant nous en essayant de paraître puissant, ce qu'il était, en réalité.Il cracha au visage du Maître :- Tu dois t'excuser pour l'avoir épousé UNIQUEMENT pour gagner les élections, déjà, pour commencer. Ensuite, pour l'avoir oublié pendant un an, la gardant prisonnière sur le Valiant avec les autres. Ah et, aussi, t'excuser pour avoir mis enceinte Alisone !J'ai levé la main vers mon ami, en révélant :- Hum... Moi, ça me va, hein. Je suis contente...- La ferme, Ali ! Si je dois voyager avec un psychopathe, j'aimerais autant qu'il se comporte bien avec son ex, qui se trouve être mon rencard, capische ?Wow...OK...\n.\nLe Maître me jeta un regard presque apeuré, puis il se tourna vers Lucy pour lui offrir son plus beau sourire et dire :- Lucy, je suis désolé pour... Pour tout ce que Lit' a dit.Après quelques secondes de silence, Lit' lui donna un coup de coude, en grondant :- Tu peux faire mieux.- Aïe ! OK, OK ! Hum... Désolé, Lucy, tu mérites mieux que moi, je pense que Lit' pourra être la personne que je n'ai jamais été.Lit' acquiesça, puis le Maître reprit :- Ah et, il faudra qu'on divorce, bien sûr.Aucun d'eux ne portait leurs alliances, de toute façon. Néanmoins, Lit' avoua :- Bonne idée, ça permettra à Lucy de se sentir libre.Le Maître réfléchit puis avoua, un peu maladroitement :- Je ne pensais pas à ça, mais pourquoi pas. Non, je veux divorcer pour pouvoir épouser Alisone.Je souris, tandis que Lit' rongea son frein en grognant.\n.\n\n.\nJ'ai réussi à convaincre le Docteur, avec l'étrange aide du Maître, pour me laisser jeter mon sort et Jumper dans la Dimension où Rose se trouvait.Je me suis mise devant le poste de commande et j'ai utilisé ma Magie pour directement ouvrir le Portail à l'intérieur du Vortex du Tardis.\n« Hierste þæt íecen sóna !!! »\nLe vaisseau s'activa toute seule, le Docteur n'eut même pas besoin de taper sur les boutons avec son marteau, car nous étions déjà en train de décoller.Le passage dans une autre Dimension était toujours violent. Nous nous sommes tous rassemblés autour du tableau de contrôle pour nous tenir aux rambardes en fer. Le Maître resta près de moi, Lit' resta près de Lucy tandis que le Docteur se trouvait au milieu.Les tremblements continuèrent ainsi durant de très longues minutes, les lumières se mirent à clignoter et une fumée s'échappa du centre du tableau de bord lorsque, finalement, le Tardis atterrit.Le Docteur se leva d'un bond pour se jeter vers l'écran et lire les données galactiques.Son visage se décomposa.Il murmura :- Dårlig Ulv-Stranden...Je me suis relevée à mon tour, en rajoutant :- Bad Wolf Bay... Là tu as laissé Rose.Intrigué, le Docteur courut jusqu'à la porte du vaisseau qu'il ouvrit à la volée. Ses pieds tombèrent directement sur le sable mouillé de la plage.Il resta choqué, sans bouger, lorsque nous l'avons rejoint dehors.Le soleil haut dans le ciel bleu nous éblouit un temps. L'odeur de l'air marin raviva mes sens.Le Docteur analysa l'endroit, puis il se tourna vers moi, le visage toujours tordu d'incompréhension et de peine.- Alisone... Rose...- Yep... Rose est là. Tu peux enfin la rejoindre.Le Docteur n'était pas une personne qui aimait faire des câlins aux gens, mais il y avait une exception à tout, je suppose, parce qu'il se jeta sur moi pour me serrer fort dans ses bras.- Wow ! badina le Maître. Tu dois vraiment aimer Rose !Le Docteur me lâcha enfin et observa tantôt moi, tantôt le Maître, en disant à son intention :- Et toi, tu dois vraiment aimer Alisone, pas vrai ?Le Maître rougit en essayant de le cacher, ce qui fit sourire le Docteur qui reprit, à mon intention cette fois :- Prenez soin de mon neveu. Ou de ma nièce. Ne laisse pas le Maître choisir le prénom, il a de toute évidence des goûts mégalomaniaques à ce sujet.J'étouffai un rire tandis que le Maître râla.Le Docteur verrouilla le Tardis et fit ses adieux à nous quatre, un par un, le sourire jusqu'aux oreilles. Enfin, après toutes ces années d'absence, loin d'elle, il partit retrouver Rose...\n..\nNous avions quitté la plage pour nous arrêter devant les falaises de la jetée. Je me suis tournée vers mes amis, frottant mes mains, j'ai annoncé avec joie :- OK ! J'ai pas mal merdé avec les Sauts Temporels et nous avons passés beaucoup trop de temps à survivre aux Timelines. - Ah ! Elle l'avoue enfin ! railla Tom dans les oreilles de Lit'.- Donc ! repris-je. Je vais nous emmener dans un coin sympa pour rire. Même rire aux éclats. Que dis-je ?! Rire LA RACE de sa grand-mère !Lit' tiqua :- Attends, tu ne penses pas à... ?- Oh, yes ! Mais avant, changeons nos vêtements.Je me suis concentrée et j'ai murmuré :\n« Tharinna imbicentra. Orpha hormanace doll... »\nDes étoiles scintillantes sous le soleil de midi nous entourèrent pour nous vêtir, par ma Magie.Le Maître sourit jusqu'aux oreilles :- Oh, j'adore quand tu utilises ta Magie, Love. C'est magnifique !Lit' souffla de désespoir.\n.\nLit' portait désormais un pantalon brun en cuir, une grande veste blanche avec, par-dessus, une fine armure argentée. Une cape claire traînait dans son dos et il avait une épée dans un fourreau sur sa gauche, calé dans sa ceinture marron. Ses cheveux noirs étaient coiffés en arrière et il avait fière allure dans sa tenue de Chevalier !Lucy portait quant à elle une longue robe, rouge toujours, mais avec de longues manches qui tombaient jusqu'à ses doigts fins. Un ample décolleté laissait voir des bijoux en or et des pendentifs de rubis et de diamants. Ses cheveux tressés cascadaient sur ses épaules et une tiare étincelante trônait fièrement sur sa tête.Le Maître se retrouva affublé d'un pantalon en cuir, lui aussi, mais avec une ample chemise brune et, par-dessus, un veston en cuir noué par d'imposants boutons. Une épaisse ceinture ornait de plusieurs poches lui permit de cacher son Tournevis Laser et d'autres petits gadgets. Il n'avait cependant pas d'épée.Quant à moi, je portais une longue robe bleu azur. Comme Lucy, j'avais de longues manches, des bretelles qui tombaient sur mes épaules et ma coiffure était un peu particulière, ce que nous appelons : « Crown Braid Hairstyle ». Pour faire simple, j'avais noué mes cheveux en tresse que j'avais ensuite entouré sur mon crâne pour faire comme une couronne naturelle, avec quelques petites mèches qui dépassaient par-ci, par-là.\n.\nUne fois que le groupe termina d'admirer nos vêtements respectifs, j'expliquai :- OK, Lit', tu deviens Sir Lit' de Westeros. Lucy, tu es Dame Lucy d'Angleterre. Maître, je dois modifier un peu plus ton nom, tu seras Sir Master de Gallifrey et moi, eh bien... Dame Alisone Master de Gallifrey. Des questions ?Le Maître leva la main :- Oui, moi ! Pourquoi je n'ai pas d'épée ?- Pour ne pas que tu assassines les gens que nous allons rencontrer.Lit' acquiesça.Je souris et je me suis concentrée sur la falaise rocheuse devant moi :- OK, je vais ouvrir un Portail et ensuite, à nous l'aventure !\n« Hierste þæt íecen sóna !!! »\nUn vortex étoilé apparut devant nous. Et je ne pus m'empêcher de penser à Perceval, qui rêvait de voyager dans l'espace. D'ailleurs, j'allais enfin montrer cette merveille à Perceval !Je tenais la main du Maître, tandis que Lit' tenait celle de Lucy, lorsque nous avons sauté dans le Portail Temporel.\n.\n\n.\n\n.\nNous avons atterri dans un tout nouvel endroit, devant des pleines vertes qui se perdaient dans l'horizon sauvage avec, en son milieu, un haut château qui s'élevait comme un monstre de roches. Le soleil brillait dans le ciel bleu de ce début d’après-midi.Nous marchâmes vers l'immense forteresse, aux remparts géants et aux douves profondes. Lit' et moi avions le sourire aux lèvres, seul le Maître ne comprit pas vraiment l'endroit où nous nous trouvions. Il râla :- Quelles sont claires ces pierres !J'ai haussé les épaules :- Elles viennent d'une carrière du Pays de Galles. Ça fait ton sur ton avec celles de Stonehenge.Le Maître ne fut pas convaincu.Lucy se pencha vers Lit', pour lui demander tout bas :- Où sommes-nous ?Lit' sourit en avouant :- Au Pays du Roi Arthur et des Chevaliers de la Table Ronde. Bienvenue à Kaamelott !\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nTHE END (?)\n\n . \n\n28.02.2023/01.03.2023/05.03.2023/06.03.2023\n\nCopyright © 2023 by Alisone DAVIES - All rights reserved.\n\n.\n\n À suivre... \n\n8 – Rassemblement à Kaamelott", "45539695000": "Once upon a time, in the middle of winter, when snowflakes were falling like feathers from the sky, a beautiful queen was leaning over the balcony from her bedroom on the second floor and admiring the black hair of her husband spilled across the shallow snow below. As blood trickled into the snow from the slash in his neck, the queen admired the contrast of the colours. The red looked so beautiful on the white snow that she wished upon her favourite constellation, “If only I had a child as white as snow, as red as blood, and with hair as black as his!”Soon thereafter she gave birth to a little boy who was white as snow, as red as blood, and with hair as black as ebony. Her little snow white, she aptly named him by the constellation that granted her wish, Regulus Arcturus Black.Lord Voldemort was the most powerful man in the world. Or so the mirror of Erised would tell him.In reality, he was a mere advisor. The monarchy that ruled the kingdom was the Ancient and Most Noble House of Black.With the firstborn Black disowned, the second, Regulus Arcturus, was Riddle’s only competition.But Regulus Arcturus, of the House of Black, would succeed the throne when his mother died- it was not long now, with her bedridden and delirious.With fair beauty, and a silver tongue, Regulus was well liked in the kingdom, but he had his doubts on whether he was the right man for the throne.“Mr. Riddle, I’m unsure this is the right thing for the kingdom.” He told his trusted advisor. “I was not raised to be King, the throne was always for my brother. How will I succeed him?”Through gritted teeth, Tom Riddle returned, “You must, it is your duty. Unless…” He trailed off.“Unless?” Regulus asked.“Unless you leave, and find your brother to teach you. Perhaps he can shed some light on what qualities you believe you’re missing to be the right man for the job, or simply reassure you. I can manage the estate in your absence. ”Regulus contemplates for a long time, before nodding his assent. “Then it is decided. I will leave tomorrow on a quest to find my brother.”Tom claps, delighted. “We will prepare you, then.”So many things could happen on an expedition into the unknown.With his own trusted advisor, Nagini, Tom Riddle, (known to the public as Lord Voldemort), began setting the groundwork for their new regime.Parliament was hesitant to consider him, as the Prince still lived to succeed the throne. It didn’t matter that he had abandoned his post on a whim.He rallied to give the power back to the people, but in reality, he wanted power above all else, and power he would get.“Nagini, my dear friend. What is a man to do? I can not kill him with my own hand… Perhaps, a huntsman to do the deed? I’m sure he wouldn’t be difficult to hunt, considering how wildly unprepared he is for wilderness survival. Perhaps he would die from that alone, though we can not risk it.”Decision made, Lord Voldemort hires a huntsman to go after him, paying handsomely for the murder of the cloaked man in the forest, to bring his liver and lungs for he and Nagini to feast on.Huntsman Greyback is desensitised to violence, and hunting a man is just as simple as hunting an animal. He will hunt anything he is paid to.But when he finds and catches the black-cloaked beauty trudging the forest, he can’t bring his knife to cut skin. When he whirls his prey around to face him, fearful-tear welled eyes stare up at him. It’s the prince Regulus Arcturus, of the House of Black.He drops the knife, and falls to the ground in a bow.“Your majesty, forgive me. I did not know it was you.”“No harm has been done, huntsman. Did someone send you to kill me?”Greyback nods.“Who?”“I do not know your majesty, but they paid handsomely. You would do well to leave and never return.”Regulus promised not to return, and the Huntsman took the lungs and the liver of a boar in lieu of Regulus’.Regulus Arcturus was alone, now full of fear at every turn- he began to run over the sharp zones and through throned bushes. As the sun was about to set, he came upon a little cottage.Knocking, it appeared no one was home.When he entered, the inside was much larger than it appeared outside, the magic awing him.He took in the home, apparently to four, picking up food and from the kitchen (he was quite hungry after the long day he had, and had lost the food he brought).He was also tired, and began searching for a bed as he munched on some vegetables. He tested every bed, finding the fourth to be just right. He settled in and fell asleep.When night turned, those who lived in the house returned.“Who has drank from my cup?” One said,“Who ate my carrots?” Said the second.“Who used my good knife?” Said the Third.“Who is that sleeping in my bed?” Said the fourth.The others followed the fourth, to find Regulus sleeping there.The first, Sirius, gasped. “That’s my brother, Regulus.“He’s beautiful,” Said the second, James.Sirius whipped around to glare at him.“Should we wake him?” Said the Third, Remus.“On it,” Said the fourth, Peter.They woke him and he explained why he was here, and the marauders gave him a chance to stay on the condition that he would help to do their taxes. Sirius remembered that Regulus was very good at math.The mirror of Erised taunted Tom Riddle with images of him as ruler of the kingdom, but Parliament confirmed that the lifeline the royals had was still intact.Riddle had smothered the queen in her sleep, so it meant that Regulus was alive.He had been betrayed by the huntsman, who now was nowhere to be found.Furious, he consulted with Nagini.“Nagini, what is a man to do? I can not get my hands dirty, but he must die so I can overthrow the monarchy.”“All men fall prey to sin, Lord Voldemort. Might I suggest a death trap? Something no man could refuse.”“I’m listening…”Lord Voldemort had known all along where Sirius lived with the other marauders. He tried his luck and sent Nagini out as a snake to tempt Regulus while the four men were not there to suspect.The snake slithered in the garden, finding Regulus laying on the grass, eyes closed to the sun, pale skin glowing in the light. It was too easy, Nagini thought, and slithered up, coiling around him and squeezing him until he died.But just then the marauders returned, and Nagini slithered away.She didn’t see that James performed CPR, reviving Regulus.“Nagini, they tell me that the lifeline for the royal family remains.” Lord Voldemort says, impatiently gazing into the mirror of Erised, wishing it was his reality.“I killed him, Lord, perhaps he was revived somehow. I did not stay to find out.”“Well perhaps next time, you should.” Tom Snapped.Nagini returned to the cottage.Regulus was bored waiting for the men to return, gazing out of the window wistfully when he saw the snake who had tried to kill him slither into the garden once again.He considered the skin might make some excellent pants, and took Remus’ knife to try to kill it.He wrestled with the snake, only for the snake to bite him, venom seeping into his bloodstream. He soon fell unconscious. The snake had bested him.“You have failed me again, Nagini.” Tom said, barely able to keep his voice level. “I suppose, some things I will have to do myself.”Tom transformed himself into an old hag, and took off to the cottage. The scent of hot apple pie wafted from a large picnic basket as he approached the little home, and he knocked on the door.Regulus peeked through the kitchen window. “Who are you?” He asked the hag.“A friend,” the hag says kindly, showing him a big, gummy smile. “I’m a baker at the village, I heard you were new to our community, and wanted to welcome you!”“Is that so?” Regulus says. “That’s very kind of you. Won’t you come in and share some with me? I can make tea.”The hag pats her stomach. “Oh I couldn’t possibly, I had quite the breakfast. I wouldn’t say no to tea though,” She says.Regulus lets the hag in, serving himself some pie and setting out a tea service for them both.He takes a bite, and it’s delicious- likely the best pie he’s ever had.“This is wonderful,” He says, wolfing it down. “What’s your secret ingredient? There’s something in here, I just can’t quite put my finger on it.”The old hag grins wolfishly. “Poison.” She says, and Regulus’ eyes widen just as he chokes, and dies.“This time- he’s dead! If you want something done, sometimes you must do it yourself!” Tom declares when he returns.The line to the throne is broken, and he begins his takeover of the kingdom.It takes the power of all four marauders to bring Regulus back- to remove the poison from his body and revive him.They plot to return to the kingdom.Tom Riddle is being sworn in when they burst through the doors of parliament, and everyone is shocked that he is alive. They check the thread for the House of Black, and find it repaired, with two heirs.“I will be ascending the throne today. And for their crimes against the Ancient and Most Noble House of Black, Tom Riddle and his advisor, Nagini, will be sentenced to walking the iron bridge over our volcano. If the Gods allow and they can make it across, they will be allowed to return to society. Unforgiving, they will perish.”Lord Voldemort and Nagini die on the bridge, and King Regulus Arcturus Black, King Sirius Orion Black and their trusty advisors, Remus Lupin, James Potter, and Peter Pettigrew, rule the kingdom.The End.", "45539655999": ["Pandora has never truly liked the Malfoy Manor.", "Nothing in particular, it just doesn't scream home to her.

On the other hand, it didn't take the feeling away from Pandora that the manor felt kind of dull and empty even if there were a lot of people present.", "Her mother always says that the manor never felt like that in the past. Instead, it was more colorful and joyful to live around and one of her best memories were inside the manor as well as some of the worst but her mother never wanted to expand more on that reasoning, she simply stood quiet and always changed the subject.", "Even if the Malfoy Manor was her family's history — Pandora never felt connected before. Hence why she doesn't like spending that much time there but for the sake of her mother — she will and she does.", "Pandora preferred the manor she lived on with her mother.

The woman that came to my house said something like that but in reality I wasn't paying attention, I was just happy I am a witch.\"", "\"Well, you're a Muggle-born. It's what you call a wizard or a witch that is born with magic but their parents are non-magical.\" Pandora explained and the train started moving.", "\"That makes sense. Then, what are you?\" Agustina asked, her face now full of curiosity.", "\"Pureblood.\" Pandora saw how Agustina was going to ask again what that meant so before she could do that, Pandora kept talking. \"Basically, a pureblood means that a wizard or witch's family goes way, way back. Their blood has no trace whatsoever on muggles or — should I say — non-magical people. Some pureblood families don't marry muggles or muggle-borns to keep the family sacred. It's stupid really.\" There was a pause for a little, \"I think you can get what a half-blood means.\"", "Agustina sighed, \"Yeah, I do. Wow.\"", "Pandora nodded, \"May I ask, how do you know english so well?\"", "\"Oh,\" Agustina giggled, \"The school I was attending gave English classes and I was always the top one in the class since I understood very fast.\"", "\"That's great! Maybe you can be a Ravenclaw!\"", "\"What was that again?\" asked Agustina.", "Pandora laughed, \"You'll know when we arrived.\"", "The two girls kept talking for the whole ride. Pandora found out that Agustina was originally going to attend Castelobruxo School but since her mother found a great job opportunity in England, they wanted Agustina to be closer to them. The Castelobruxo administration contacted Albus Dumbledore and they let Agustina attend Hogwarts. Pandora started wondering if Agustina didn't attend Hogwarts then perhaps she wouldn't be making a friend right now. She was grateful to the universe that she was here with her.", "The train soon came to a stop and everyone got out of the compartments. A very very tall man was yelling that first years should come with him. The girls didn't question it at all and went with the tall man like the rest of the first years.", "Pandora spotted Amelia Bones, Amelia looked at her and waved. She waved back.", "The first years took a ride on a boat. Agustina seemed pretty excited about everything that was going on all around her. Some students were, others weren't that much fazed by it.", "Pandora always knew that Hogwarts was described as beautiful but Merlin, it was even more beautiful in person. She found it breathtaking.

She could not wait for the next seven years at Hogwarts with them."], "45539656002": "", "45539656003": "", "45539281000": "A mixture of sixth year students coming from a variety of houses sit in the Potions classroom, chattering about as per usual. They believed that it would just be an average day at Hogwarts, especially with their first week back. They quickly come to a stop once Professor Sharp enters, his presence commanding attention to all.Professor Sharp drawls out. “Everyone. You all know your place here. You've all performed exceedingly well with your O.W.L.S. You must be thinking how much you deserve a spot in my very class, one that is of the advanced N.E.W.T. level. In fact, I want you all to perform your very best until you finish your schooling.” He pauses for a dramatic effect. ”So perhaps, a partner could help gain you motivation to succeed in this class.”Professor Sharp conjures up a magical bowl with strips of paper inside and grunts out. “Your names are all written here. I'll be drawing lots on who'll be partners. And yes, you'll be partners for the entire year, so you both better get along swimmingly.”He draws out the first pair of names. “Right, I almost forgot. You will have to be partners with one in the same house as yours.” He smirks. “That'll teach you that if your partner costs you due to a mistake, then both of you go down. On the contrary, if you and your partner work well together, then you gain double the points.”He drones on to read the rest of the pairs.Bianca sits there in the familiar dungeon, anxious to know who'll she be paired with.Moments pass by and she still isn’t called. She glances at the Slytherins in the room and only one still hasn't been called. Could it be...?Ominis, who was one of the later names to be called, was nervously waiting for the name of his partner to be called out. He sat there, his wand clasped in his hand and his eyes trained on the bowl.He wasn’t even paying much attention to the speech given by Professor Sharp until a couple of names had already been drawn out. Once he’d heard that, he was listening intently, and began to wonder just who he would be partnered with. He prayed it was someone nice at least!“Ah.” Professor Sharp droned. “Last but not the least, we have Stone and Gaunt for the Slytherins.”The room was in an uproar. “Professor! This is outrageous, both of them are the brightest students of your house!” A student grumbled. Bianca didn’t check, but she believed that it was most likely a Ravenclaw, mentally rolling her eyes.Professor Sharp raised his eyes at the student. “Yes, I'm well aware of that. But we don't know...” He makes eye contact with both Bianca and Ominis. “Perhaps competition and rivalry could overcome them.” He smirks.Fortunately, he immediately removes his attention on the pair. “Anyway, I've assigned you all to your specific stations. Now do get there as we'll already begin our first lesson soon to test things out.”Everyone scrambles and Bianca hurries next to Ominis. She gracefully sits down, in spite of anxiety building up inside her.Ominis closed his eyes for a few seconds, taking a few deep breaths before opening them and looking around to see he was, luckily, alone with his partner. He relaxed slightly.“It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm Ominis Gaunt.”“Yes, I know you. I'm Bianca Stone.” She hesitates a little bit, but then continues. ”It's funny how this is probably our first ever interaction when we've been housemates at the same year for so long now.” She chuckles, nervously trying to lighten the mood.“I'm afraid I'm not very good at being social most of the time - I prefer just to keep to myself.” He adds. “I can't say I'm particularly fond of potions - and I have a funny relationship with the dark arts, but I shall try my best.” Ominis also chuckled.Gaunt was hoping that Bianca was a little patient with him. His heart was, in all honesty, beating extremely fast.“I keep to myself most of the time too, actually. Probably why I haven't talked to you before.” She sheepishly grins, relieved that they had broken the ice. “And Ominis, you're too humble. You have a natural affinity for potions, same as your family. You're only second best to me, and you don't even try.” She widens her eyes, immediately noticing her mistake. \"Not that I've been noticing you, at least.\"Ominis smiled a bit more, seeming to be happy that Bianca had been so nice to him. “Well... I try to be the best. I guess I'm just one of those people who sees how the others are doing and realizes there's always someone better.” He seemed a little bashful to be complimented in such a way, but it was clearly something that made him happy. He looked down at the desk, taking a deep breath. He didn’t expect the compliment from her, and wasn’t used to praise like that.She smiles at him and notices his rather adorable quirk. She was about to say something but was interrupted.“Alright, get your textbooks out and turn to page...” Professor Sharp drawls out to the class.Right. Bianca needed to put her head into this and prove to the professor that Ominis and her will be one of the best pairs he's ever laid his eyes on. She listens attentively to the lesson.Ominis hoped he wouldn’t make too much of a fool of himself. He paid particular attention to the instructions and made sure to follow them properly. He didn’t want to get off on the wrong foot with his partner, or make Professor Sharp annoyed. He focused solely on the instructions, making sure to work steadily with her, without too much fuss or worry. ____________________ By the end of the lesson, it felt like a little weight had been taken off his mind... for now.Bianca didn't expect how well Ominis and her had performed. It was like a ballroom dance, both of them moved swiftly yet elegantly.Professor Sharp approaches their workstation. “My, my. What an outstanding result. 20 points to Slytherin”. He continues on with the rest of the pairs, some actually performing poorly, and some performing just about right.Bianca glances at Ominis. “Hey, you did really great back there.”“Thank you - I'm just glad I didn’t drag you down. You’re a great partner to have... most of the people I know just treat me like some kind of lost puppy or something, so having someone that… actually gives me a reason to try other than ‘if I don’t, then I’ll get screamed at by the teachers’ is… I mean, I can’t say in that many words what it means to me to have someone actually believe that I can do something, other than ‘be blind.’Ominis seemed a little embarrassed to say all that.Bianca seemed taken a back by his oversharing. Had this really been happening behind the scenes? Do people treat Ominis lesser due to his disability? “Is that true? Do people think of you that way? That's awful. How are they to think of such horrible things when you were able to perform amazingly today? You're such a skillful wizard and your blindness doesn't hamper you at all.”She gets a determined look in her eyes. “Right. Ominis, if someone ever says things like that to you, lead the way. I'll immediately hex them into oblivion.”Ominis was slightly taken aback. He hadn’t expected such a reaction. He was used to people treating him like that - it was almost a constant at this point.This girl was something else, though…“I don’t know what I’ve done to make you want to protect me so much… but thank you. You really are the best partner here.” Ominis seemed truly grateful to her for being on his side like that. Something that he had never quite felt before…“Well, I'm your partner now after all, and I am willing to stick up for you.” She states that as if it was a matter-of-fact.Ominis seemed a little surprised about that. Usually the students were all in it for themselves, and would turn on each other in an instant, not out of any actual hatred or anything of the sort, but just because they wanted to better their own odds.Having a partner that would be there for him… he felt like he actually stood a chance this year.They pack their things up and leave the Potions classroom, continuing their conversation elsewhere.“You… would do all that for me?” He started, slow yet unsure if she really meant all of that.Bianca nods. “Yes. I am looking at someone with a lot of potential and power, Ominis. Just know that others belittle you out of their insecurities. They can never be as successful as us. I protect one of my own since we're too alike, you and I.”Ominis seems a little taken aback by that. “I… I’ve never met someone as great as you, Bianca. If you can promise me you’ll watch my back, then I promise I’ll do anything that I can to help you in return, no matter what.”Ominis reaches out his hand. “I’ll be glad to work with you the whole year… but not only for the homework, or the tests. I want to protect you too.She is startled by his statement, as she coughs and blushes. “You don't have to return the favor, really I'm just as grateful. But alright, if you insist.” She shook his hand gently and grins at him.Ominis smiled in return. He had always thought himself a rather dull, unremarkable person, so to have someone like her be so kind to him had brightened his world up like the sun in the sky. “I... I really like being your partner, Bianca. It's like... I'm not alone anymore. We'll stick by each other, won't we?”“Sure we can. We'll help each other out by tutoring lessons, quizzing each other, practicing the recipe, and what not.”Ominis was glad to see her not just agree, but to seem almost enthusiastic about the idea of partnership. This girl was much more of a kind and caring person than he had expected - and that made him want to be the best partner for her. He had someone to look after now, and he’d do all he could to not let her down. That sounds perfect. “We’ll… we’ll both be top of the year together in no time, won’t we?”“Yes, Ominis.” She laughs. “Just like as we always do each year.”Ominis chuckled, seeming to like her confidence. “Great to hear! That just makes this year even better than it already is!”He seems a bit brighter than he had been when he first walked into the classes. Something about being his best seemed… appealing.Not just so that he could impress himself, not just for the professor, not even really just for the award anymore…But for her, too. _______________________ They were out of the dungeons already and wandered around the school grounds with the harsh sun striking their faces.Bianca squints her eyes against the brightness, and then glances at Ominis. She begins a silent laughter. “Ominis? You seem to have gotten a few bits of our ingredients from the class earlier on your cheek.” She chuckles and wipes it off gently with her soft hand.She continues, while snickering. “I'm sorry, I didn't even notice it before since the classroom was so dark, but now that we're out and about here in broad daylight...”Ominis is slightly surprised by her sudden tenderness. He takes her hand for a moment, his other hand on his heart. He felt like someone had just thrown warm water over him - it was an unfamiliar sensation… the feeling of a true friend. “Thanks, Bianca. I’m not used to having people who… who care about me like that around.”She is startled by his sudden touch but then frowns for a bit, contemplating what he said. What did he mean by that? Do others snicker behind his back and not tell him anything whenever something's off with his appearance or clothes, just because he's without vision?“Ominis, I hope you won't mind, but I'll have to change that soon. Even if it meant me breaking out of my own shell of keeping to myself. I'll show everyone how truly wonderful of a person you are, just they wait.”“You think I’m wonderful?” Ominis seemed a bit flustered by that.From the way the other Slytherin boys treated him, he had always just assumed that no one would ever see him as anything more than “the blind one” or “the snake”.The fact that Bianca seemed to take a liking to him had made his heart flutter just like… well…Like a love spell had, maybe…“Thanks, Bianca. It would mean a lot to me if you would do something… like that… for me…”“Look Ominis, we may have interacted for the first time in less than a day, but you've already proven your strong character.”“You… you think I have strong character?” Ominis seemed both surprised and pleased to hear Bianca say that. He had just been trying to stand up for himself, to... to get people to see him for who he was and not just the title that went before him.He hadn't expected to... find a friend, someone who he could talk to about anything, who would be willing to tell a whole classroom how great he is... it amazed him. “Thanks, Bianca. You've kinda made my day, you know that?”She hums. “I don't know why, but I guess my intuition assumed that you would've needed that. And I'm glad I've made you overjoyed, Ominis.”“Just... thank you. Just for everything.” Ominis seemed to smile. He had the feeling of being at the top of a mountain, as if just one good thing after another had happened to him, and it was only just beginning. A look of excitement appeared on his face, as if he couldn't wait to see where he would go. ______________________ Hours go by painstakingly slowly, as if the two had all the time in the world. They talked about quite a lot of things and neither of the two seemed to have felt dulled by the conversation topics at all. They were like bursts of energy that constantly flared.Ominis didn't want the day to end. He wanted to have this feeling for forever, but time waits for no one - and he knew that.If time allowed it, he would have stayed here and talked to Bianca, or gone off with her around the castle to try and find hidden rooms to practice their magic in, or even just to hang out in each other's company.This, of course, was all a hypothetical, as he slowly slipped back into reality. “Thank you, Bianca. You've made my whole week.”She grins at him, yet is saddened that they had to end the conversation so soon. But quick as her mind was, she thought of something. “Hey, would you mind if we sat together at the Great Hall? We've talked for so long and my mouth is parched.” She chuckles. “But funnily enough, I could never get enough of your talks, Ominis. What do you say?”Ominis thinks for a moment and... decides that yes, they'll go together to the Great Hall. Despite the fact that he should probably get some sleep after the conversation with Bianca, he wanted to keep talking to her for as long as possible.“I... well... normally, at this time of day... I'd probably just head back to my dorm and go to sleep... but I don't want the day to end... so of course I'll go with you.” He grins.She widens her eyes. “Ominis! Do you usually skip your meals? It's only dusk!” She smacks his arm lightly, not enough to result to pain. “Well, anywho, now that I'm here I'll always make sure you don't skip them. Won't you, Ominis?” She teases with a caricature of a sinister glare.Ominis nods, looking sheepish. “You're right - I should probably stop skipping meals, shouldn't I?” He sighs, giving in to the pressure from Bianca. “Alright... I guess you'll have to watch over me for me and make sure I'm eating properly, and not skipping any meals while you're at it.” Ominis chuckles to himself, looking like a child caught stealing candy from the kitchen, but he seems genuinely grateful for Bianca's efforts to help him.Her eyes soften. “Look, I was doing that for lighthearted fun by pretending to act like an overbearing mother, but I also do skip some meals sometimes due to busyness and outright forgetfulness.” She bashfully gazes at him while admitting this. “But don't get me wrong though, I was just as sincere too.”Bianca’s mood suddenly seems to rise. “Say, how about we become accountable to each other? Ensuring that we'd always eat? That'd way we'd have the best of both worlds, we can talk together while also making sure we put at least something in our stomachs, yeah?”Ominis nods excitedly. “That sounds great, Bianca. You make a great accountability partner. I'll make sure you eat, you'll make sure I eat.” He smiles, seeming genuinely excited about this arrangement.The best of both worlds, indeed, and he couldn't have done it better by himself.He holds out his hand to seal the deal. “Shall we?”Her soft hand grasps his as she shook it in acceptance. “That's funny. We've shaken hands already twice today, Ominis. You seem quite fond of doing that.”“Is that a problem?” He seems almost mischievous when he says this. “Don't tell me that you're tired of shaking hands with me! I can always find another way to make a promise! Or... just take your word, I suppose. But that's so much more boring!” He chuckles, trying his best to look serious but failing in the most adorable way possible.She chuckles at his antics. There's that again. Bianca notices. Another one of his endearing quirks. She's eager to let Ominis remove his mask for more of those, that's for sure.“Well, how are you saying that when we don't know that it could've been your excuse to feel my soft hands, hmm?” She raises a single eyebrow, her eyes full of mirth.Ominis is taken aback.The way she said that sounds... almost a bit flirty...But that certainly isn't the case, she just means it as a jest!“Well... you know I won't answer that one! I have to have some secrets, don't I?” He grins, holding his fist up. “Just you try and make me answer that one, Bianca. I dare you!”“Alright then.”She tackles him to the soft, grassy ground and tickles the life out of him. She knows this might be torture for him, but he's laughing and she's laughing and seeing him like this... It's awfully exhilarating. “Tickles always work, Ominis.” She says triumphantly.Ominis’s face turns bright red as he breaks into a fit of hysterical laughter. He’s never been tickled before and... oh, he just can’t stop laughing! With tears in his eyes, he tries to speak, but he just breaks into even more laughter, his hands trying and failing to push Bianca off. “I- I… I surrender…! I s- surrender! Please!”“Only if you admit it, Ominis.” She grins, making no move to get off him.He takes a deep breath in, trying to get his breathing under control after the laughter. He tries his best to be stern - or at least as stern as he can while a bit out of breath.“... fine, fine. I... I do enjoy touching your hand, Bianca.” His face remains bright red, but he smirks a bit at the end of his statement. He seems both happy and embarrassed, but mostly happy.“You sure you're saying the truth? Or are you just making it up so that I would stop?” She smirks. Before Ominis could react, she immediately followed. “Okay fine, I was kidding!”She gets off and tends to her robes, checking for any dust. “Seeing you like that, Ominis, it was... It was the most fun I've had in such a long time.” Her eyes were full of fondness, it seemed like there some sort of twinkle to them. “And yes, I knew I was right all along.”Ominis’s face brightens up again. He’s never had a friend that he could joke around with! It makes him incredibly excited to know that Bianca likes him this much.“Of course I was telling the truth! And... and seeing you have a laugh like that made me happy too. Maybe… maybe we should hang around each other more often, Bianca? I mean… if you’d like it.”“Took you long enough, Prat.” She grins, happy to have won Ominis over as a friend. “As for the hand holding though, I didn't know you were the physical touch type. But I wouldn't mind if you held mine every now and then.” Her eyes widened, instantly regretting what she said due to its implications and blushed.Ominis takes the offer with gusto. “I like getting physical, Bianca. I’ll hold yours every now and then. Heck, I’ll hold any part of you that I can reach!”He was clearly not thinking about how the “implications” of the previous statement are.Not that he likes Bianca, but rather that he’s a very physical person.She widens her eyes. “Oh... I...” She starts to make uncontrollable snorts and giggles. “It seems we've both said the most peculiar things to each other now.” Her snorts and giggles gradually become boisterous laughter and he joins her along, for the wonder of it all.Ominis laughs uproariously with Bianca. This was the first time he had ever had a true, honest-to-goodness, laughing friend!The two shared a moment of true friendship that just... well, it was a bit beautiful.After a minute or so, he finally calms down from the laughing fit he was going through, his breath shaky from all the laughter. “Merlin… I've never laughed so hard, Bianca. That was amazing. That's... that's just what I needed.”She lies her back on the grass and gazes at the stars, then starts giggling again. “You know Ominis, the funniest thing is, it seems that dinner's already over at the Great Hall. And we're supposed to be accountability buddies.” She turns red and laughs once more.And, as Bianca begins to laugh hysterically again, Ominis feels himself about to join her in the laughing fit when he remembers the food.He quickly sits up and goes to stand up. “We really did lose track of time... we've have to get ourselves to that dinner table!” He extends his hand to Bianca to help her up. It's clear that he wants to get to the dining hall - and fast.She calms down from her laughter and takes his hand to hoist herself up and dust off her robes. “We don't need to go there, I think the tables are already empty. But we could come to the kitchens though and ask for those adorable house elves for any leftovers.” She smiles at the thought of meeting such a creature.Ominis relaxes a little; while he'd love to get some leftover dinner, he's certainly not adverse to talking with the house elves if they could get away with it. It might be a grand little adventure!“Oh... we should probably do that, shouldn't we? I think a little adventure would be nice, don't you?” He smiles, excited.He seems like someone in the prime of his life at this moment, and... he can't remember the last time he had one of these moments.“Alright, I'll lead the way, Just hold my hand already, I'm sure you're eager to do that again.” She teases. ________________________ They avoid anything that might suspect them, blending into the dark, and miraculously were able to reach the kitchens without any trouble.Ominis follows her lead, a huge grin on his face. He holds her hand to help guide them in the darkness. He's really excited to see the house elves - it'll certainly be something new for him. He wonders if they'll just be cute and pleasant, or if they'll do some special magic around the castle from time to time.After a while of quietly sneaking along, he looks down at his hand in Bianca's and gives it a little squeeze in affection.Bianca hums. “What was that for?” She whispers in the dark.His face goes a little red from the question, but he answers her with a smile. “Oh... just...” He pauses, wondering how to answer that. “... you make me really happy, Bianca. It's that simple.” He squeezes her hand again. “Just trying to show a bit of my appreciation for how much of a good friend you are.”Sometimes, it's times like these that Bianca succumbs herself into dark irony. Because oh, how she was glad that Ominis couldn't see how flustered she instantly looked right now all because of his words.She knows it's sick and twisted and of course, she would never let Ominis know of this type of humor she has.“Ominis, I'll treasure this day as much as you'll do, but we need to hurry up. We can't get caught.” She begins to brew a joke to hide these weird feelings she experienced. “Imagine, two of Slyherin's brightest students in their year in trouble for sneaking late at night. That'd certainly be something.” She shakes her head and moves forward again.Ominis laughs. “I think it'd be quite the sight to see, actually.” He follows her, still holding her hand, but keeping a sharp eye out in case they get caught.He was glad they could both laugh through the situation - and he was glad for the companionship.As they sneak along, Ominis holds her hand more tightly - the feeling is more comfortable now than it was the first time they did it, and he has an idea for getting more food in their bellies while they're still in the kitchen...At last, they've finally reached the quarters and saw the giant pile of food on the table. The house elves always make more than enough, that's for sure.They banter quietly, making sure to not make any noise. “Since I was the one who had the idea of being accountable for you, then I insist Omins, take the first bite.” She smiles softly at him. “It's probably my fault anways how we lost track of time, due to my tickling prowess.” She snickers.Ominis holds up a plate that he took from one of the stacks, and smirks at Bianca. “Fair enough, Bianca. You may have had a play in us losing track of time, but you were...” He sighs, looking at her fondly, “... you were worth it.”Ominis offers her the plate first. “No? Or shall I have the first bite?” He gives her a smile as he holds the plate out to her. Whatever the case, he'll eat after she does.She rolls his eyes. “I didn't know you had a stubborn side to you Ominis.” She hums. “Let's just eat together, alright? It's getting too complex now on who goes first.”Ominis nods. That seemed like a very fair thing to do; since they had lost track of time, they might as well lose track of who eats first, right? He grins.She giggles. “On the count of three...”“One, two, three!” Ominis starts to bite into his meal the same time Bianca does.Bianca is amazed at this magic. She's sure the food's been prepared hours already seeing as it was leftovers, but it tastes just as fresh and warm, like a blanket that keeps you safe.Ominis takes bite after bite and smiles, nodding approvingly. The elves never fail to amaze him with their culinary mastery - and this is just a basic meal! They certainly didn't let up, even with the leftovers... and that's only proof of their dedication. They must love their work.He keeps eating for a few seconds, smiling at his food. “This food was made by elves, do you believe that? They prepare it using a wand and magic, and they work magic that we can't even begin to comprehend!”They hear a little squeak in the corner of the room. “Speaking of house elves...” Bianca mutters.Ominis looks up at the squeak and pauses mid-bite, his eyes wide as he realizes their predicament.“Master's!” A little house elf emerges and whispers frantically. “You shan't be here!” She looks behind back her with worry.“Wait, wait, wait! We mean you no harm. We just came here for food. We never would have gone this far if we'd known we'd be in danger like...” Ominis trails off, before finishing his bite of food.He looks at Bianca with an apologetic glance, but there's almost a mischievous, boyish gleam in his eyes. He might be in trouble, but it might just be fun.Bianca is entranced by this but mentally snaps herself out of it.“Hello little one.” Her voice flutters. “I'll let you know what happened. See, unfortunately, the two of us missed dinner because we lost track of time. We promised each other to stop skipping meals, so we can't have already failed at that, you see? So we went here. And can I just say how wonderful the food tastes?” She smiles warmly at the house elf. “What's your name, by the way?”The little house elf is looking at her like she's the most wonderful person in the world. And, for a little while, that makes Ominis smile, too. He's glad that she's taking it well, and that they both got a good laugh out of the whole situation.The little elf introduces themselves with a big smile. “I am Flapjack! Thank you for the compliment, little human!” Flapjack squeaks happily.Ominis is happy that they've just gotten a new friend!Bianca internally coos at the house elf's adorable displays, but she then whispers. “Flapjack! Please keep quiet, you must not let the other house elves know we've been here. It was awfully nice to have met you, you're very charming! But we need to keep going, it's getting even more late. Maybe we'll see you next time, if we miss our meals again that is.” She glances at Ominis and rolls her eyes at him.Ominis looks between Flapjack and Bianca, then rolls his eyes with a smile, too. He's had an actual, good honest-to-goodness time - he'll have to do this with Bianca again sometime!Flapjack nods understandingly at Bianca, then winks at Ominis with a grin. From the looks of it, he seems to understand that they're in a little bit of trouble, but that doesn't mean he isn't having fun.“Alright... we should... probably leave...If we ever come back Flapjack, know that we'd be here.” Ominis gives a small smile. Bianca grins at the house elf. “Thank you so much for your kindness.”They all bid their goodbyes, with the two going back into the dark. ______________________ Bianca didn't know how quiet the surroundings got until she heard her own loud breaths.Ominis listens carefully as well, breathing in through his nose deeply to try to hear everything around him. He has a pretty good memory for all the nooks and crannies and secret places in the castle, as he had to get around the castle without being spotted.The two begin to walk along the dark castle corridors once again.Ominis smiles a little at her. “Wow...” He says in a very quiet voice that almost sounds like a whisper, “... that was actually a really fun adventure.”Bianca was about to reply, until.“What was that? Who goes there!” They hear the Lumos charm being cast and feel panic.“Quick, hide!” She grabs Ominis' hand to lead him away from that man.They squeeze together into a very small spot. Their bodies pressed against each other.Ominis immediately follows Bianca as she pulls him to squeeze somewhere out of the way. He is quiet and unmoving, trying to stay as still as possible so that their presence in the secret corridor is not noticed by the stranger.He seems a little afraid that their hiding spot will be discovered, but he says nothing in an attempt to remain quiet. He tries to control his breathing, too, to ensure that he is not making enough noise to give away their position.Bianca instantly regrets the hiding spot she selected out of panic. Out of all... Their bodies are pressed too tight against each other and it's making her feel dizzy. She doesn't know if it could be teen hormones or the adrenaline rush. She notices Ominis trying to calm his breathing down and does the same.He eventually feels her reaching and squeezing his hand. Ominis jumps a bit at Bianca squeezing his hand, but he still squeezes back. Well, that's one of the firsts, he notes.The footsteps and bright light approach nearer. Bianca focuses hard, thinking of something, anything that could help them.A loud clang is heard in the opposite corridor. “Hey! You! You better not be a student wandering about late at night!” The voice scatters off.Did Bianca just.... No, it can't be.Ominis squeezes back again with the hand she is holding, then he smiles at her just a little bit - his way of thanking her, if they make it out.They wait for the stranger to go a little bit away. Then, very tentatively, they try to move slowly to slip out from their hiding place.They didn't dare to make another sound again, with the fear of almost getting caught. ___________________________________ Soon enough, they reached their common room and entered, with no student seen in sight due to slumber.Ominis makes his way over to the chairs with Bianca and slowly sits down, his eyes wide with disbelief at the situation they just escaped from.He seems to be a little excited as well - it's certainly not a good idea to be out of bed during the night, much less sneaking around, but sometimes, a little adrenaline rush could be nice if no one got hurt...Ominis pulls Bianca down next to him, whispering very quietly at her in between breaths. “Did we just... break all the rules in one night?”She giggles. “Oh please, Ominis. I'm sure we're not the first to have done such in Hogwarts. But I didn't ever imagine doing all of that with, you of all people, and having such a fantastic time at it as well.” She grins and makes a mocking voice. “Oh, what have the brightest students in Slytherin got themselves into?”Ominis laughs quietly. “I'm not complaining. And to answer that question, I'd say... We got ourselves into an adventure!” Ominis looks down at Bianca with a smile. He pauses for a second. “Would you like to do this again sometime?” He pauses again and seems to be waiting for an answer.“Do this again? Are you kidding me?” She gives him an incredulous glance and is silent for a long time, making him worried.“Ominis, broaden your horizons a little.” She teases. “There's so much more to explore in Hogwarts besides what we saw today, maybe we could even encounter untold secrets...”Ominis blushes with excitement as Bianca teases him. It's not an emotion you would expect from someone as quiet as he, but it seems that a shared misadventure has gotten him very much pumped up and out of his shell.He nods profusely and beams at her. “That sounds like an amazing idea! I'd love to!”“Then we'll have them. But oh, Ominis... I have to tell you something.”Ominis seems to lean closer as Bianca begins to speak, interested in whatever she has to say. “What is it?\" He looks at her with big eyes, hanging on every word. There's that mischievous little gleam in his eyes again, too - he can tell that something interesting is coming up.“That loud clang we heard when we were back there? I felt so certain that was my doing.” She whispers in a hush. “I felt the magic pooling out of me and extending itself into anything that would get us out of that predicament. I didn't know I was capable of such non-verbal, wandless magic, Ominis... I don't know what to feel.”Ominis stares with his jaw dropped, trying to grasp what she'd just told him. “Bianca,” he says slowly, still shocked and still trying to wrap his head around everything she's said. “That was..”. he looks around as if to make sure no one is listening “...that was one of the most impressive things I've ever seen a witch do.” He beams at her but shakes his head in wonderment.Ominis sits completely still and silent, still stunned by her magic and trying to think about it all. Bianca can see in his eyes that he's already thinking about possible experiments - or, at least, thinking about what she could do to help her figure it out and learn more about it.He has a smile on his face while doing so, a look of curiosity and eagerness to discover something new, like he's always been a little obsessed with it. “Do you think... you can do it again? Can you feel it happening?”Bianca concentrates on trying to do any of the simplest of charms, but to no avail. She sighs, “I believe that must've been due to such an adrenaline-surging situation, Ominis. I can't do it right now, since besides your presence making me feel undeniably safe and with no real danger happening, I'm not feeling any of my magic emanating out of myself.”Ominis is still watching carefully, curious and waiting. His smile seems to widen a little bit at Bianca's comment, but he looks up at her with a small, mischievous smile. The look in his eyes seems to say ‘I bet I know how to change that’ without actually saying it.He leans toward her a little, not making any noise, and whispers in an almost conspiratorial voice. “Would you like to find out?”“What... do you mean by that?”Ominis gives her a little wink and continues whispering. He can't help but have a little smile on his face - he's quite enjoying their little adventure.“Well...” he begins again in a slightly teasing whisper, “I think I might know how to get you to use that magic again...” he pauses, grinning and raising his eyebrows at her “...if you're game, that is.”Bianca hums. “I don't see why we can't try. But we have to be utterly quiet, lest we wake the entire house.”Ominis is still grinning, but he becomes quiet again so to not wake anyone. Bianca can almost hear the wheels turning in his brain as he thinks of ideas, but she can't be sure what kind of scheme he's thought up this time. He's about as devious as they come.He tries to think of something that would be just scary and exciting enough to get Bianca's adrenaline going. He almost immediately has a good idea and almost seems to have forgotten where they are as he thinks about it.“Ominis? What do you reckon I should do?”It takes a few seconds for Ominis to remember where he is and what his task is, as he seems to be entirely in his own head, but then his mind clears.“I was thinking... Maybe a little scare game? I can pretend to be some kind of dangerous monster... just for a little bit... but it could get your adrenaline going, which might get a response out of you!” He's still grinning, and he leans in a little, as if listening, to see if she likes his idea.“I... I don't know. I think it's too risky right now Ominis. Maybe we should head to bed already, I'm feeling tired from failing to recreate such magic with simple charms already.” She snorts. “Maybe this was just a one-time thing.”Ominis seems to deflate a bit - he was looking forward to trying out his plans, now, but he seems to take her decision gracefully. “Well... if it's a one-time thing, I would love to study it. For future reference, of course.”He tries his best to look sympathetic and concerned, but she can tell that his mind is already thinking about what they've talked about tonight. The gears in his head are turning again already as he seems to make a mental note.“Well, I do wish to control it somehow. So fine, we can do these as long as we do it away from Hogwarts itself. Perhaps in the woods? People can't know of my ability in this, I don't know what they'd do to me lest they find out.”Ominis raises an eyebrow. “I promise to protect your secret with my life.” Bianca's ability is something that he's interested in, and it would be very bad if it got out. If someone found out, they could be very dangerous, and they could use her as a sort of weapon, or even lock her up just to figure out how she did it. “But let's wait for... the right time. If we do this, it can't be rushed.”“Yes, certainly. We need to be discreet, Ominis.” She yawns and rubs her eyes. “As long as we plan it whenever I'm not barely half-awake. I have to rest now, okay? And we'll talk about this soon, where there aren't many prying eyes.”“Good night, Ominis.” Without noticing it, Bianca absentmindedly kisses his cheek, almost out of reflex, due to tiredness. She heads up to her dormitory. She wouldn't recall it right now, but as she wakes up the next morning, she'd feel absolutely mortified.Ominis blushes as Bianca kisses his cheek, his heart speeding up and blood pumping. Even so, he says nothing as she gets up and leaves, still smiling.“Sweet dreams...” he says a bit more quietly. “Good night.”Not too long after, Ominis gets into his own dormitory. He lays down and gets ready to fall asleep.His heart is still beating fast from her kiss, and the feeling is new and very exciting to him.His mind is already trying to plan and plot how he can make the most of it, and just as he starts to drift into a slumber, a smile spreads over his face, with gears still turning in his head."}
