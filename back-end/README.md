## Back-End Requirements (Front-End Integration)
1. The back-end must expose an HTTP GET endpoint, accepting URI-encoded:
```
GET url.com/query?=this%20is%20query%20text
```
2. An API call to the back-end must return `JSON`-structured data:

```json
[
	{
	docId: int,
	url: string,
	title: string,
	excerpt: string
	}
]
```
3. The back-end must handle pagination by accepting a `page` and `limit` parameter:
```
GET url.com/query?=...&page=1&limit=15
```

If `limit` goes beyond items available on the last page, the endpoint must return the maximum amount of available items.
