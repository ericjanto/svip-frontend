Mate you alright?\"\n\n\"Oh god Moony! Sorry I…\"\n\n\"No it's okay, what's got you in a hurry?\"\n\nJames pretty sure he had this funny expression in his face and still feeling the unusual anxiousness\n\n\"Have you seen Sirius?\"\n\nRemus brows furrowed into a frown\n\n\"What's he done now?\" he asks a little harshly\n\n\"nothing, but I didn't saw him in class today or in the hall I didn't even notice if he's in bed this morning and I know, you both still…\"\n\n\" Breathe James, Yes we clearly still aren't talking and no I haven't seen him either\"\n\nThere was a little tensed silence between them and Remus was about to say something when Lily walked up to them\n\n\"Lupin,Potter,Professor McGonagall is asking for both of you\"\n\n\n\n\nRemus felt his stomach drop when Lily told that McGonagall is askit for both of them, he's already feeling a little queasy specially since this morning then added by James frantically looking for Sirius\n\nHe might have been a harsh when James asked if he saw him but the still hot anger melted into concern\n\nYes he's still angry, talking to Sirius, talking about Sirius or even anything about Sirius still make him want to lash out, because it still hurts\n\nThe betrayal felt like a knife lunged deep in his chest and twisted\n\nSirius was the one who made Remus lower his guard more, the one to tell him that his scars are part of him and not a grim reminder of who he is the one who would talk his ear off into recovery after every fullmoon, he made Remus feel the safest\n\nIt was like a bucket of ice cold when he woke up after that fullmoon and was told of everything the happened , told to him by Sirius himself\n\nHow could you?\n\nHow could you use me?\n\nWhy did you do it?\n\nAnd then Sirius just hung his head, not meeting his eyes, fists clenched\n\n\"I'm sorry, I'm so Sorry Moony\"\n\nAnd that was enough, Remus had enough\n\n\"Stay away from me…from now on, Stay away from me\"\n\n\"Moony–\"\n\n\"Don't call me that, you can't call me that, you lost that right\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, I'll do anything, Please\"\n\n\"Anything? Then stay away, I don't want you near me ever again Black\"\n\nHe had said that, venomously\n\nAnd since then, even in the dorms everywhere, Sirius did stay away, he was alone, he comes and goes, he would look when he thinks Remus doesn't know,he did as told\n\nAnd Remus felt the frustrating conflicted feeling of gratification and worry,\n\nHe wants to run up to the boy,shake him and tell him to take care of himself and stop with all this self punishment, and then there that satisfying feeling of seeing him devastated and hurt and knowing all the consequences of his actions and it makes Remus' stomach churn\n\nnow as James rambled about how he haven't seen Sirius since morning , it adds to the uneasiness that is crawling up Remus' skin\nThen Lily told them that McGonagall is looking for them\n\n\nAll three walked to where McGonagall had asked them to meet them, and if Remus and James are already at their wit's end , they've been tethering as they approached the hospital wing\n\n\nWhy the hospital wing?\n\nIs this about Sirius?\n\nIs he okay?\n\n\n\"Professor, they're here\" Lily announced\n\n\"Thank you Miss Evans\"\n\nLily have a nod and stepped aside not leaving the room, McGonagall looked at her with a silent question and she pursed her lips as she gave another nod, and if one pays a closer attention, her eyes are already red rimmed, McGonagall let her stay then\n\nShe looked at both boys, her expression neutral but her eyes are grim and there's a tremble in her voice as she spoke\n\n\"I'm sure both of you are curious why I asked you to be here,And it would be best if you see this for yourselves, I'm sorry but I can't think of any other means to tell this to you boys\"\n\nBoth boys looked at each other before following, they're at the very far end of the wing, there stood Peter with Marlene,with madam Pomfrey who's joined by McGonagall, in front of them is one of the hospital beds, curtains drawn\n\n\"Pete? Marls?\" James asked confusion masking the now fear in his voice\n\n\"Why are you guys…\" Remus wasn't even able to finish his sentence\nPeter just shook his head unable to speak as he choke on sobs and Marlene wraps him in a side hug as she cries\n\"What's wrong? What's going on?\" James is already impatient at this point\n\n\"Mr.Potter…\"\n\n\"Please, just tell us what's going on\"\n\nRemus cuts off, not wanting to be rude but he doesn't want to beat around the bush any further\n\nMcGonagall lets out a silent breath and looks at Pomfrey whose eyes are also downcast, she opened the curtains\n\nLike ice was poured on their bodies both Remus and James froze, eyes wide as they stare at the one lying on the hospital bed\n\nSirius…\n\nSirius is on the hospital bed, still in his sleepwear from last night, but it was torn, dirty,and bloody, his feet filled with wounds\n\n\"He was found by the lake this morning, I'm sorry boys\" Pomfrey says voice low\n\n\nSorry? What does she mean by sorry? Can't she do anything? She's the healer, can't she heal Sirius?\n\n\n\"He's gone! He's gone!\" Peter wailed loudly this time\n\n\"No…\" James denies\n\nRemus felt his world shatter, as he stares at the lifeless body\n\nIt can't be…\n\n\"No! No! Remus, Moony, this can't be right, Padfoot , Sirius is not… Remus! Why aren't you saying something, why are you quiet, this is…\"\n\n\" James… \" It was barely a whisper, as if all of his strength was shucked out of him\n\nWith the remaining will in his body, James went forward and takes Sirius' cold hand\n\nJames can feel his knees go weak and Remus tries to catch him and brace the fall but fell with him as James lets out a silent scream then a strained wail\n\nThe hospital wing was filled with painful cries, plea and denials\n\n\"W-who did it?\" Remus ,still clinging to James had his eyes on McGonagall\n\n\"Who killed him?\n",
	"45745042000": "It's a bit unusual in their dorm right now. Somehow Remus Lupin ended up in it. Looking as torn appart as he did the last days. When he and Regulus stupid brother stopped talking for whatever reason. Probably because Sirius abandoned them like he does with everybody and everything. They finally accepted that after all he is just a black.And after three days of Lupin looking like somebody nearly killed him and he's a living dead now, he came to him. To be more precise he came to him, Barty and Evan. The look in his eyes made it verry clear that there is an important reason behind this, so they decided to let him into their room.Now he is here and he seems to hesitate. Sitting uncomfortably on Bartys bed, his bag kind of slouched into itself. Like he wants to hide of being with them. Him the big Gryffidor, speaking with them the Slytherins, who are dirt to his feet. Or at least that is how the marauders usualy behaved about their relationship. And something seemed to be important enough to make him come here. Against his better kowledge. Poor boy. Or more idiot.\"Well Lupin we don't have all day, tell us what you want or leave.\"As usual Barty breaks the silence at first. Regulus just rolls his eyes. If it had been up to him he would have waited. And waited. Till Lupin felt awkward enough to break. He's the one wanting something from them. They have the power. But now the damage is done and it get's at least faster over. Because it is true. He has other things to do.\"I uh...well I.\", in any other time the older boy is very good with his words. From what Regulus noticed he could talk in quite a flow so that people like to listen to him, different than his brother or Potter. Who always scream way to much and are just generally annoying.\"Spit it out.\" and yes Regulus would have holded his breath for an eternity, for not giving up the higher position. But this was already broken by Barty and now his patience is getting lower. Especially when he sarts to think how this all could have been a prank of his brother just to get his nearly lover into a Slytherin dorm.\"I want revenge.\" Suddenly Lupins hole body changes. Like he made a decission to trust them and now he will stick with it. This is his way to go now, his hole back straightens and there is no fear on his face anymore. It is a typicall stupid Gryffindor move of putting everything in you have. If you asked Regulus he should defitnetly hold more back and don't give them so much information this easily.But he does. Idiot. Again.\"Good for you genius, don't we want that all. What has this to do with us?\" , he snaps back.\"Verry charming Black. Just listen to me. It is about your brother he wronged me terrible. Missused my trust in him a lot. I want to pay him back, to make him hurt as much as I do now. I figured to come to you. I thought if there would be anybody to make me help hurting him much it would be you. So here I am.\"\"What did he do?\", Evan asks calmly.And this is why it is perfect to have Evan in their group. Barty would have been to daring while asking this. Regulus would have sounded to much like he doesn't give a fuck. Which he doesn't to be honest. What his brother does or does not do is not of his buisness anymore. Well ok maybe in this specific situation he cares. But usualy he doesn't. Whatever.Evan on the other hand sounds perfect. He has enough caring in his voice so that Lupin doesn't feel like they don't take him serious. But this sounds cleanical enough to assure it is important for the following that they know about it.But it seemes like his brothers ex lover doesn't care for all these good reasons. His back goes stiff and he squints his eyes. There is no information coming from him.\"Good you won't tell us, fine. But what do you expect us to do?\"Now there is a scamming smile on his face. \"I thought the best way to get to him would be to make him jealous. I'd like to make an open invitation with this to you.\"Now there are different ways to read into this. Possibility number one he wants to have a relationship with him. Would be a smart move, nobody would hurt more that to choose the little brother over yourself. But Regulus came to often in Sirius second place. There is no way in hell he would do this out of free will again. Even if it is just some fake dating nonsense.Additionally to this there is this deal he made with Pandora. A deal in which he would work more on getting into something, anything really with James. She can't stand his and this is a quote \"sad boy poetry\" anymore. So she forces him to go after it instead.So no dating with him and the boys know this as well. They each turn their head to each other and you can see the same thought in their head.Option number two.For various reasons it won't be possible to just date Barty or Evan. But even better they could be a ménage-a-droit. And in their eyes you could see how they love it. Barty more, he looks like he wants to jump onto Lupin. But Evan is interested aswell. Good for them.They all turn to Lupin again.\"I think you made yourself a deal. Evan and I are going to be your new partners.\"\"Congratulations on that, you will want to hex yourself pretty quickly.\" Regulus only adds to it.If the Gryffindor is surprise by this he doesn't show it. He quickly nods and than leans himself foreward. \"How do we want to do this.\"Now is the perfect timing to announce for Regulus his other plan that comes for him all together now. This is perfectly usable for his deal with Pandora.\"Oh no worries about that. I have the perfect idea.\"***The next morning they all walk into the great hall like usual. The others accepted his plan easily and now it is his time to shine. Instead of walking to the Slytherin table like they are supposed to do, all three of them walk to the Gryffindor table, where the hole sixth year is already seated. Most of the hall falls silent as they walk. This is an interesting turn of events nobody expected when they woke up this morning.As planed and promised yesterday Lupin sit's closely enough to Sirius. Still some room between them but in a way that he can see and hear everything.Next to their new partner sit's Potter. As predicted. Everything acording to plan till now.Of course Regulus wouldn't be Regulus now if he wouldn't have an entire break down as he walkes. It is definetly a genius way to come closer to James as he likes and dealt with Pandora. But it is also before the entire school. So his anxiety and his hole body hates him for doing this. But he always was a stubborn ass and he wont stop it now. This will happen.Potter doesn't even sees them coming. Strategically placed and get's up from his seat right in the perfect timing. You can say about Lupin what you want but this guy is great at planing and making things happen exactly like they should. Probably why all the pranks of their group worked so great.Then Regulus only has to turn James on his shoulders so that he stayes up front to him. The poor boy doesn't even realise what's happaning to him. He just smiles to Regulus and get's out an \"Hey Reggi, wh...\"Till Regulus kisses him with all he has. And it is great much more that it was supposed to be. This just should have been a little fling to make Regulus forget him. But now it get's worse. Why does a heterosexual guy kiss like that.To Regulus defense he isn't just pulling himself onto James who really doesn't wants that. In this way this would have been just an easy kiss. But no. James actually pulls him closer.Then it ends and after all Regulus nearly forgot to look at his brothers face. But he doesn't and it pays of. The amont of betrail on Sirius face almost looks like what Regulus felt the day he left him.\"And we also take this one with us.\", Barty laughes, the only one seeing everything that happened light enough to speak. He grabs Lupins hand and pulls him away with them to the Slytherin table.This is going to be an interesting month.",
	"45744898000": "The first time Sebastian wondered just where he and Ominis would end up this summer had been on the train ride back to London. Every year before this his uncle would’ve been waiting for them in London, taking them back to the small place they called home.Now, however, he had nowhere to go. He could stay at the home all alone, but it wouldn’t feel right. There would be no Anne, no Solomon and no one else, the Goblins had murdered pretty much every last person who lived in that place.Going to the Gaunts wouldn’t work either, the family absolutely despised Ominis, that’s why the boy always spent the summer at his place.“We’ll figure something out.” Sebastian muttered, “Maybe stay in a hotel or go camping that could be fun, right?”Ominis didn’t respond, he hadn’t done a lot of talking after he decided to not turn Sebastian in. The only thing that gave Sebastian some hope for it ever going back to the way it used to be before this year was the fact that, while not talking, Ominis also hadn’t left his side for a moment.That, of course, could also be because the boy just didn’t trust him.“I’m sorry,” He whispered, before turning away and grabbing a book- not on dark magics, no he left those behind. It was a book he had found, a diary of sorts by Rowena Ravenclaw of all people. He couldn’t make sense of the words, it were words of a grieving woman that much was obvious, however it seemed to be random thoughts written on a paper.Beside his confusion, the book made him feel something, gave him something to focus on beside his urge to learn more spells that were forbidden for such an obvious reason. The addictive magic had been all that was on his mind lately, the only things that stopped him were Ominis and the book he was currently holding.“I’m not angry,” Ominis said, so suddenly that Sebastian wasn’t sure if he had imagined it or not. “Just worried, there’s a reason I despise Dark Magics, not just because of my past. It’s hard to say goodbye to them once you have accepted them as part of your life.”  He sounded bitter when he said the next sentence, “I would know.”“I never intended to worry you.” Sebastian said, not sure if there was anything else he could say.“I know you weren’t, that only makes it worse.” Ominis sighed, “Just, stop thinking I hate you or anything. I can practically hear your self-loathing because of it and it’s kind of pathetic. We both know I could never hate you, Seb.”“But we also both know that me doing Dark Magics against all your warnings is too far,”“And I’m glad you finally realised that.” Ominis replied, “Acceptance is the first step to healing from this poison.”“You really mean it?” Sebastian asked, looking Ominis in the eyes even if the other boy could not see it. He sounded smaller almost child-like, “You’re not angry?”“I mean it,” Ominis promised and while Ominis didn’t claim his family title with pride; the one part he did take with pride was the ability to lie so easily. It was part of being raised in the Gaunt house, no mask pretty much meant no life once you’re older than six.Because even if he really wished he could just hide all his anger under the love he had for his best friend, say that it was just a little mistake, he couldn’t help but feel a little angry. At himself for not trying harder to stop all of this, but also at Sebastian- the one person who knew just what he had been through- for not stopping after he had warned him multiple times.That hadn’t stopped him from at least trying to find a place to stay for both of them, he had asked around trying to find anyone he trusted who could give them a place to stay. Until eventually his favourite professor offered them to stay with her, she was alone anyways and spent most of her time away from home.“It would be good to have someone to take care of all my little flowers,” She had said after approaching him about the subject, “Just think about it okay?”Ominis had told her they accepted a week later, without even discussing it with Sebastian.“I have already found us a place,” Ominis said suddenly, deciding that maybe he really should tell Sebastian, “Unlike someone I actually think of these things before going back to my non-existent home.”“You found a place?” Sebastian asked, “Where?”“You’ll find out, have some patience, Seb.”Ominis could feel the curiosity coming in waves from Sebastian, he didn’t need to have sight to know the boy was probably looking at him, trying to read his mind about where they would spent the summer.“It’s someone we both like, stop worrying.”Sebastian decided that he trusted Ominis enough to at least reply with, “If you say so.”Ominis smiled, “You’ll like it there.” And maybe burrowing his anger under all the love he had for his best friend was easier than he thought just a few minutes ago.~Professor Garlick was waiting for them at the platform and Ominis just smiled at Sebastian’s excitement. Garlick was everyone’s favourite professor, besides the few people who absolutely despised herbology.“How did you even manage to make her-““She offered, Sebastian, she somehow just knew we needed a place.” Ominis said, “She’s probably going to be away from home most of the time, but she didn’t mind us staying.”It was only when Mirabel Garlick actually approached them, that Sebastian believed him.“Boys! How was the trip?” She asked excitedly, Sebastian smiled at her, “It was nice, thank you, professor.”“Oh! Please call me Mirabel, no formality in my house.” She said, “Are you ready to leave?” She asked then looking at their bags and the other students. Ominis nodded, “I have everything.”Sebastian nodded, he never had a lot to begin with. The goblins had taken a lot of him the past few years, till the point where he only had some clothes and his wand to actually take with him to Hogwarts.She offered her arms to both of them, Sebastian gently guided Ominis hand to one of her arms, after realising he didn’t notice the offered arm, before grabbing the other one.Mirabel smiled softly at the action before they apparated to her house.The house- which was a small cottage in the middle of a field, there was one path leading away from the cottage, Sebastian expected it lead to a nearby village.- wasn’t much, like Mirabel had warned Ominis, but it looked peaceful.“Thank you, for doing this.” Sebastian said, “I know it must be a lot to just take in two-““It’s nothing, I’ll enjoy the company and I have a trip planned with friend this summer. I was hoping you would be able to take care of my plants and cats, you should do fine. I’ve seen your skills in both Herbology and Care of Magical Creatures.” Mirabel said, “Now do you want to see the inside of the house.”Sebastian nodded, while Ominis just reached for his wand, the spell didn’t exactly allow him to see anything, but it was the closest thing he had to sight.Their teachers happily led them into the house, immediately greeted by one black and an orange cat. She smiled at the little creatures, “An elf usually takes care of them, since I can’t spent the time I want to spent with them at Hogwarts. They never got along well with other cats and there’s a ton of those in Hogwarts.” She petted one of the cats, the other gently nudged her leg with it’s head. “That doesn’t mean I don’t miss them, of course, I have always loved cats and these two they’re special to me.“I trust neither of you fear cats?” Mirabel asked, Sebastian shook his head, “We’re not.”“Good to hear,” Mirabel said, “I’d hate if you spent your time here in fear. It is vacation after all. I’ll show you to the bedrooms, I only have one guest bedroom, but I trust you don’t mind sharing?”“We don’t,” Ominis was the one to speak up this time, “We’ve practically been sharing bedrooms every night for four years now.”Mirabel nodded and started leading them to a hallway on the other side of the small cottage, there were three doors there, “The bathroom,” She said, pointing to one door, “And there’s your bedroom.” She opened the door to a room, it had a big window allowing the sun to come in, the entire room was made from wood mixed with light green and yellow colours.Sebastian quite liked how it looked. The two beds were now separated by a small nightstand.“Do you want the window bed?” He asked Ominis, who snorted, “You think I care?”“Hey! I’m just being polite, offering you the bed. Besides the entire other bed is red.” Total lie, but sometimes it was fun to-“The fact that I am a descendant of Salazar Slytherin does not mean I despise the colour red, I have told you that before. Besides, I don’t really ‘despise’ any colour, since I don’t know how any of them look.” Ominis said, while he claimed the bed closer to the door. “Maybe green really is the uglier colour.”Sebastian smiled, “I think you would like green.” He paused, “You look great in green, after all.”Ominis just snorted again, used to these comments from his best friend. “I’m sure you’d look absolutely disgusting in it.”“Hey!” Sebastian said, laughing slightly.~The first few days were kind of hard to get used to just how calm this place was, Mirabel mostly left them alone, usually spending times with her plants or going to the village close to her home.Once or twice they went with her, but more often than not they spent entire days playing dumb magical games they used to love to play before everything with Anne happened. Mirabel also enjoyed teaching them new spells, harmless jinxes that she loved when she first came into the wizarding world.After two weeks Mirabel went away for her trip with the simple instructions to give her cats and plants enough attention, the elves would do the rest.So they ended up alone.“Sometimes I wish I could lend you my sight,” Sebastian said, “I would do so in a heartbeat, just to allow you to see a little bit of this world. Some of it is actually pretty amazing.”The both of them were laying on the field next to Mirabel’s house, Sebastian was looking at the clouds that seemed to magically morph into shapes, while Ominis had his eyes closed. It was so unlike any vacation before. The first few vacations Ominis had spent with Sebastian’s family were fun, although often they had a lot of things to do. His uncle didn’t want them to be lazy. Then Anne got sick and everything changed.For the first time they could really just relax, no one was telling them to do anything.Ominis sighed, they had this conversation many times before. “I honestly don’t know if I’m missing something, it’s always been like this.” He paused, “At least I don’t have to see you all day.”“I think you’d love the way I look.” Sebastian said, voice full of confidence.Ominis turned to his side, knowing Sebastian had probably turned a while ago to be able to look at him during talking. “It’s nice, though? I can just meet anyone and not have any judgement from the way they look. There’s so many people who are absolutely amazing, but not necessarily pretty, right? So nobody likes them.”Sebastian nodded, it made sense a world without judging anyone simply by their looks, how nice that would be.“Can I ask you something?” Sebastian asked after a long pause.“What is it?”“How did you know?” Sebastian said so softly, “Everytime something almost went wrong or I was in danger you showed up.”“I have to compensate for the blindness in some way, don’t I?” Ominis asked, “It’s like this feeling I get. I was worried this year, Seb.”“I know you were.” Sebastian muttered, putting a hand on Ominis’ cheek. “I’m sorry for worrying you.”Ominis smiled slightly, “I know you are.”“I don’t think you know how sorry I am,” Sebastian said, moving his hand from Ominis face, instead before he carefully put his hand over Ominis’. “You saved me, not from all those Goblins, but from myself. I never noticed what I was doing until it was too late. I have never felt more sorry about ignoring someone’s warnings.”Ominis turned his hand around, allowing Sebastian to carefully grab it. “Now you know.”“I do.” Sebastian answered, “And you have every right to be angry, but somehow you’re not because you are the best person ever and it just makes me wonder-“ Sebastian smiled, they could never stay serious for too long.Ominis laughed, feeling where this was going.“Are you an angel?”“I’m way too traumatised for that.”“Are you? Oh damn, I was so sure I finally figured you out, maybe I could have dressed you up in all white and convince people you are my guardian angel!”“You ruined our beautiful friendship moment, Sebastian!” Ominis said and Sebastian smirked, “That’s what I’m here for, is it not? Without me this friendship would be one gross, too sweet, friendship.”“There’s nothing wrong with being nice.”“Are you even hearing yourself right now?” Sebastian asked, “I mean you are one to talk, you’re the most sarcastic person I have ever met, you seem to enjoy insulting people while sarcastic, most of them don’t even hear it’s sarcasm you know?”“Yes, well, that’s funny.”“Is it?”“I think it is and I am pretty sure you have said you think it’s funny before.”Sebastian turned back to the clouds, pulling his hand away in the process, “Right, You’re so funny.”“And you are an asshole.”~“Ominis are you actually asleep?” He whispered into the blackness of the room.“I’m not.”“Do you want to-“ Sebastian sighed, “Nevermind.”“What?” Ominis asked, Sebastian breathed in, “I don’t know, put our beds together?”Ominis snorted, “You are such a child sometimes, was that that hard to ask?”“What?”Sebastian casted a Lumos allowing him to see Ominis searching for his wand, patting the bed and nightstand. He smiled softly, before handing him his wand, after he noticed it on the ground.“We did this all the time, Sebastian. I was honestly expecting you to ask the first night.” Ominis explained, “So we’re doing this?”Sebastian nodded, even if Ominis could not see it. He was aware that every year before this one they had been forced to share a bed, it had never been weird.But it was different now, it felt different.Ominis moved away from his bed, waving his wand once, moving the nightstand away then he waited till Sebastian moved the beds.It was only once he laid there that Sebastian just realised why this, all of it, felt so different than any of the times they did the exact same thing before.He turned around, facing Ominis, the moonlight that had been hidden earlier by clouds now coming through the window, making the boy look even prettier than he usually did.“Merlin’s pants. I’m cursed.” Sebastian whispered into the emptiness of the room, hoping his friend really was asleep this time. He lifted a hand, leading it back to the place it had laid that afternoon, on Ominis’ cheek. This time however, he didn’t quite let the hand actually touch his friend.His hand was shaking and he slowly moved it back, his breath shaking. There was a lot he expected from this break, but this-It wasn’t something he ever imagined to happen, he always had thought of himself to be someone to not get into a silly teenager relationship during his time at Hogwarts.But with Ominis, it suddenly didn’t feel so silly anymore.He forced himself to slow his breathing, not get into a useless panic attack about the fact that he really was in love with his bestfriend, he forced himself to close his eyes, maybe he could still get some sleep.~It was after five days of silent pining and everyday Sebastian thanked the gods that Ominis couldn’t see him staring at him for hours with a soft smile on his face.However today was immediately different, when Sebastian woke up he noticed a pressure on his chest, an arm wrapped around his waist. It was the first time this had ever happened in the past four years. Ominis had never been a big cuddler and Sebastian had easily accepted that.“I can hear your confusion.” The boy mumbled into his chest, “Make it shut up, I want to sleep.”Sebastian chuckled, moving one of his hands to play with Ominis’ hair. “I thought you hated physical contact?”“Sometimes, but you love it.” Ominis sighed, “It’s called a sacrifice, besides I don’t mind too much when it’s like this.”“Why today?”“You were annoying me,” Ominis said, as if that explained everything.“Okay?”“Just because I can’t see it does not mean that I don’t feel you constantly staring at me, or whisper curse words while you’re laying next to me. I didn’t think it would be that big of a realisation.” Ominis muttered, “But I suppose you were always the oblivious one.”“You knew, the whole time?”“It’s been so obvious,” Ominis replied, “It’s one of the things that scared me most the past year, the fondness in your voice was just gone. It’s like you totally forgot about all of it. I spent weeks loathing myself for never making a move, because I was scared to ruin whatever it was between us. Now, however, I notice it’s impossible to keep ignoring whatever this is.”Sebastian didn’t know if he wanted to kiss Ominis or hide in embarrassment, the boy however made the choice for him when he sat up and leant above him. Sebastian leant in, allowing his lips to softly touch Ominis’.Ominis pressed back and Sebastians embarrassment fade away totally, he realised how right Ominis was, they both had been waiting for this for at least two years. All he could think about now was Ominis, the boy seemed to have taken over his entire life, he seriously doubted if it was healthy how much he would let Ominis influence his life.But he knew all the boy would do is keep him safe.Then Ominis pulled away and rested his forehead on Sebastians, laughing slightly.“I can’t believe we waited so long to do that.”“Sorry for being so oblivious.”  Sebastian apologized, not sure what else to say.“You should be, we could have done this a while ago.”“Didn’t you just say that you knew all this time, but didn’t want to ruin our friendship?”“Yes, I did, but I wouldn’t have rejected you if you asked me out.” Ominis said, “Which technically you didn’t even do.”“Oh, so I have to be the one to ask the other out?” Sebastian asked and Ominis shrugged, “You seemed like you would die from embarrassment if I asked you out.”Sebastian had to admit, this direct way Ominis chose had probably been a better idea, “Okay, well than you absolute idiot, will you go out with me?”“Oh, I’m the idiot?”“Of course, I mean I could not possibly be an idiot.”“Why is that?”“Because you have high standards and would never date an idiot, meanwhile I love my idiot boyfriend.”“We’re boyfriends now, huh?” Ominis asked, “With this attitude, you need to take me out before you get to call me that.”“Sure, whatever you say.” Sebastian replied, kissing Ominis’ nose, “Well are you ready for a really romantic picnic date?”“I have been for the past two years.” Ominis replied, smiling at Sebastian.Sebastian couldn’t help but pull Ominis into another kiss.When Mirabel returned home and she saw the closeness between the boys, she secretly cheered, before going inside to hangout with her cats, she was exhausted from the trip with her girlfriend.",
	"45744640000": "\"An owl is coming.\" announced the Irish man with his heavy accent, his blond hair was long and tangled –but everyone in the pack had long, tangled and dirty hair. Except Remus, who's hair was barely chin length. It was too long for his own liking, but werewolves who lived with packs barely cut their hair and kept it long.He needed to fit in with the rest of the pack to achieve his mission, so it was a sacrifice had to made –although Remus wouldn't really call it a sacrifice. Many things in his life wasn't to his liking, and he had learned not to bother himself with it.The owl came in a minute or so, Remus didn't know, his sense of time had been warped ever since he started this mission. There was morning, noon, afternoon and night; they didn't even bother to count the days. After all everyone instinctively knew when the full moon was.Merlin knows how much Remus wants to go back to his friends. A damn disgrace I am to werewolves, he thought. Missing human society as if \"I'm human.\"The owl arrives, Remus gets closer to the others while they open the letter.\"Dark Lord has fallen!\" the leader announces, keeping her cold but rest of the pack is shaken. Whispers asking \"How?\" and \"When?\" emerge.Dark Lord has fallen, words echo in Remus' head.\nWe won the war.\nAnd without saying a word, he apparates to the headquarters.\"Whoa.\" said the Irish man. \"So that fella was a spy.\"\"Can't be, the only werewolf working for Dumbledore is Lupin. And he lives with humans.\" responded the brunette man.\"Maybe he worked for the Dark Lord.\" another one said.\"Would explain why he left all of a sudden.\" approved the Irish.\"He was Lupin himself,\" interrupted the man they call the Redhead Jim, he was the most educated one in the pack. \"We called him John but his alias was Romulus at first remember?\"\"I don't get the point.\" said the brunette.\"Remus and Romulus were brothers, founders of Rome, they were raised by a wolf.\" explained Jim. Voices of realisation arose from the pack.\"That's why I told you folks to avoid talks directly supporting the Dark Lord.\" said the leader.\"You knew? Why let him stay?\" asked Jim.\"If the war took a turn, I thought, and if we supported the Dark Lord, minister and his dogs would hunt us down. Lupin boy directly reports to Dumbledore, probably –he would say that we didn't show clear support to the Lord, just tested the waters like everyone does– and would save our poor asses. And we'd have a good laugh at Greyback.\"\"Good thing we have a clever leader.\" said the Irish, laughing, the pack started chanting the leader's name in support.•It's late in the afternoon, Mary MacDonald is trying to enjoy a cup of tea sitting in the kitchen of Order's headquarters after a long day of work in St. Mungo's. I need to find a flat and move out, she thought. Living here is too painful.All of a sudden she heard an apparition sound from the entrance, who could it be, she wondered. Now that the war was over, the old cottage that was once the place they planned their next move barely had any resemblence of life –except for Mary who kept living there with Dumbledore's permission. With not-so-old habit of keeping a hand on her wand, she approached the door.It's Remus.His hair is overgrown and dirty, his clothes are worn out –and dirty. He is even more scrawny than the last time she saw him, Mary doesn't know how that's possible. He looks tired and unhealthy, but there is something sparkling in his eyes. And he stands there.\"Oh, Remus.\" she sighs in relief, rushes a few steps to hug him. He smells awful but she doesn't care. A friend that is still alive feels like a blessing.\nDoes he know they are– No, does he know the war is over to start with?\nMary lets go of him after a long minute, but now Remus knows something is wrong. Mary never hugs for that long, let alone that dearly.\"They say the war is over, is– is it true?\" he asks, his voice is overflowing with hope.\nHope.\n\"It's, oh Remus, it's over but–\" she can't do this. She can't tell him, not a chance. And Remus notices, \"Who?\" he asks. Can't be Lily and James, they are safe, he thought. \"Is it Sirius? Peter? Both? Dumbledore?\"There is tears in her eyes, her lips are twitching but she doesn't talk.\"Tell me something, please, for Merlin's sake.\"\"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm–\" she crumbled to the ground crying, leaving Remus in shock. \"Traitor,\" she mumbled. \"Sirius, it's–\"\nSirius is... the traitor?\n\nThen– then James and Lily?\nHe apparates once again, leaving Mary crying in the entrance. This time to Godric's Hollow.The lovely house that was once held very dear memories is in a half-rubble state. \"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no...\" he murmurs to himself rushing inside the building. He looks at the traces of the fight, looks at where his friends gave their lives. He wonders what happened to Harry, was he dead too? He assumed he was, unless they got Voldemort before he got Harry.There was still a lot he didn't know.He wanted to go home, to the flat he shared with Sirius. He wanted too see traces of regret and stress in there; a broken cup maybe, or the room left messy, or a note of apology.Because the Sirius that Remus knew wouldn't betray them. He must have been forced to do so. Because he wouldn't do that. He wouldn't.But the house was the same as it ever was.  There was no broken cups or a note that Sirius left. It was the same as always.But nothing else was the same.\nSirius did it.\nAs the truth hit him, he no longer could stand being there, stand where Sirius used to stand, be where Sirius used to be, he was furious.He hesisated for a split second to apparate back to the headquarters, he was gonna splinch for sure, but then the thought of it didn't seem that horrible. So he apparated.And he splinched.\"Are you back Remus?\" Mary called him from the kitchen. \"Fancy joining me for dinner?\"\"I splinched.\" he called back in pain, left side of his torso was covered in blood already. It wasn't bad, by Remus' standart for injuries, but it felt worse than it was in the situation.Mary approached the entrance for the second time that day, this time in a rush, and settled Remus into a couch quickly.\"It's not that bad.\" Mary said patching the wound after casting a ton of healing spells.\"Feels worse than it is.\"\"Everything does nowadays.\" she sighed. \"I cried over a broken plate yesterday.\"\"This somehow sounds familiar...\" said Remus, meaning another time Mary broke a plate and cried over it.\"Oh shut up!\" she hit Remus in the shoulder lightly, her frustration could be seen on her now pink face; slightly smiling but it doesn't mask her sorrow. \"I'm done.\" she exclaimed a while later. \"Don't re-open the wound.\"\"Thanks.\" he said getting up from the couch.\"Will you stay for dinner?\"\"I think I will. Thanks, again.\"They moved to the kitchen, Mary went back to her uncooked chicken on the counter and Remus sat in one of the chairs next to the table. There is a newpaper on the table.It has a photograph of Sirius printed on the front page. He holds one of the signs they give to prisoners, he wears those striped pyjamas prisoners wear.\nAnd he is laughing maniacally.\nHe reads a bit of the paper while it still lays on the table. \n\"...the murderer of Peter Pettigrew and 12 Muggles, Sirius Black, who has been caught by Auror Office on the same night he commited the crimes, 31th of October, is today officially centenced to a a lifetime in Azkaban...\"\nTime stopped for a few seconds and Remus snapped.\"FUCK!\" he yelled and threw a punch to the wall, causing Mary to turn around in panic. \nJames is dead.\n\nLily is dead.\n\nPeter is dead.\nHe threw another punch to the wall, his knuckles were bleeding–\nHe killed all of them.\n–then he threw another and another and another...\nHow could he?\n\nHow could he have done that?\n\nHow could he do that?\n\nHow?\n\"Remus calm down–\" Mary said, hesisant to reach him. She heard Remus talking about werewolf temper and how he could get uncontrollably violent before, but she never saw him lose it. Remus and anger was two things that didn't fit together.Remus turned around to face Mary \"CALM DOWN?\" he roared, Mary fliched back, \"I LOST EVERYTHING MARY, EVERYTHING–\" then he saw the fear in her eyes.\nFear.\nRemus took a few steps back in realisation, \"I- I didn't mean to, I'm sorry.\" he felt like vomiting now.He lost control.\nHe shouldn't have.\nHe rushed his hand through his hair, he felt tear filling his eyes. \"And I learn all this a week later, I couldn't even attend their funeral, I- I don't even know where their graves are.\" he took a deep breath in, and let it out slowly. \"Oh, Mary, what am I gonna do?\" he sobbed.Mary couldn't say anything for a few minutes. James, Lily, Peter... They were her friends too but Remus was the one who truly lost everything. And Sirius to turn out to be the mole...Remus wouldn't go and stay at their flat, Mary knew that. She also knew Remus enough to know he wouldn't move back to his father's house.\"You can stay here, with me.\" she said, attempted to wipe the tears off Remus' face with her hand but Remus drifted away.  \"There is a bunch of empty rooms here and loneliness has been killing me.\" she added.\"I can't.\" he managed to blurt out between his uncontrollable sobbing, covering his face with his arms. He slowly crouched and sat in the floor, tears still rolling down from his cheeks.\"You saw me.\" he said a while later. \"I'm unstable, and the moon's in four days. You won't be safe.\" \"For Merlin's sake, Remus, the building is made out of stone, not cardboard.\"\"But–\"\"And I am a healer, mind you, you need me.\"There was quiet.\"Thanks.\" he murmured, embarassed. \"Is the room at the end of the hall empty?\"Mary nodded.\"I'll go... And sleep, I think.\" Remus said, getting up from the floor.\"Dinner?\" she asked, knowing he would refuse it this time.\"I don't think I can stomach anything.\" he replied.\"Goodnight then.\" she said, knowing it was far away from a good night.\"Goodnight.\" he said, knowing it was the worst night of his life.",
	"45744622000": "I have heard it said that love turns people soft, but I have never been more brutal.\n\n— Elaine Kahn, Romance or The End.\n — It had never been a thing Sirius thought of very much, not because it wasn’t a thought worth having, but simply because in the midst of the war, 1976-1981, it didn’t seem so important. But Merlin above, Remus was beautiful. Now that Sirius knows the whole story, now that he understands how it was all going to end and he has time and time in spades, he thinks about it more. The soft curve of Remus’ lips. The way his eyes danced over pages too quickly when he read. The delicate features of him, and the hardened ones, too. The bits too soft to touch and too heavy to hold. Remus was coloured in siennas and greys, warm brown hair that was just a little too red in the right light, waxy skin sheened with sweat, amber eyes. He had a scar on his jaw, right here. Sirius reaches out into the cold of his cell and in the dim light of the moon, he can almost touch it. That little scar. They had been beautiful, hadn’t they? All of them. Remus and James and Sirius and even Peter. They were forces to be reckoned with, once upon a time. Sirius thinks about who they were before they were anything noteworthy, before the whole Wizarding World knew their names, and he thinks it should ache, but it doesn’t. Peter Pettigrew: died too young, with too much brutality, nothing but the smallest of his fingers left behind. A rat. A warning. A premonition of something far worse than a broken friendship. Peter was a lesson Sirius spent his whole life refusing to learn: it is only the people we love the most that can hurt us this deeply.James Potter: murdered. Murdered. Dead, though he was never meant to die. He was the protagonist, the hero, the star of the story; he was not meant to be doomed by the narrative. He was supposed to live. But now he’s dead, and the only glimpses of him Sirius can catch are in other people’s mouths, in clips of newspapers, and on rare, sunlit days. Remus Lupin: left behind. Discarded. Broken. As he always thought he was, as he always knew he would be. Remus is a self-fulfilling prophecy in the sense that maybe, maybe, if he hadn’t tried so hard to be alone, he wouldn’t be alone. He always bit with too much teeth. Snapped with too much force. Sirius should’ve expected this, and yet, at least Remus is alive. Sirius can forgive that, as long as Remus is alive. Sirius Black: imprisoned in Azkaban for a crime he might as well have committed. He doesn’t mind the solitude of prison — kind of likes it, actually. It makes him feel as though his life in Hogwarts was just one long, idyllic dream. It’s all soft and hazy around the edges anyway. Like squinting at the sun for too long. And Sirius doesn’t mind that occasionally he’ll hear Barty’s voice a few cells away, because Barty once belonged to Regulus, and for all of the grief Sirius has suffered, he misses Regulus like no other. Two dead. One missing. One alone. And one imprisoned. But Merlin, Remus was beautiful.  — Professor McGonagall, bless her soul, tries to defend Sirius. She does. She visits him in the temporary cell they’re holding him in and she shakes his shoulders and she tries to get something out of him. Do you know who the traitor was? Sirius, we’ve not got time, you have to tell me what happened. If you don’t speak, I can’t defend you in this trial. I know you didn’t do this. Tell me you didn’t do this. Sirius? Sirius!Sirius doesn’t speak. He can’t remember how to move his tongue.In the end, Professor McGonagall puts up a fight when they drag her out, but Sirius doesn’t look at her. Doesn’t think he can without thinking of her fond smile when James was appointed Head Boy, or the stern downturn of her lips when she gave them all detention. She’s a relic, anyway. An echo of a life Sirius wishes he never lived. He should’ve never met James Potter. Damnit, he should’ve never met James, the fucking dick, he should’ve never given the gold-speckled arsehole the time of day. Damn you, James, damn you to hell and back, you weren’t supposed to die. Why were you so easy to love? Why were you so easy to lose?Sirius doesn’t think about Remus. Refuses to think about Peter. All he can think about is James. Someone escorts him to a courtroom, and someone else unchains his wrists from the shackles but keeps the cuffs chaining his hands together. It takes a few nudges to sit Sirius down, but he does and thinks about how James used to take his tea. Two sugars, no milk. “... of the third of November, 1981, into offences committed by Sirius Orion Black,” the judge says. Barty Crouch, Sr. Sirius notes with disinterest. “The charges against the accused shall now be read into the record: the murder of Peter Pettigrew. The murder of twelve muggle witnesses. The murder of James and Lily Potter and the servitude of Voldemort during the height of the war.”Sirius observes the crowd of onlookers in the courtroom. They’re all confined to one side, where the ziggurat-shaped seats reside, carved from dark stone. That whole section of the courtroom is full, and Sirius, though his mind isn’t really there, can vaguely make out a few people in the mass. Professor McGonagall right at the front, thumb in between her teeth. Professor Dumbledore beside her, a dark look in his eyes. Some students Sirius went to school with — Sybill Trelawney, most notably, near the door. Parents of people that have died already, parents of people that will be dead soon. Mary Macdonald. Walburga Black. Harry Potter, in Petunia Dursley’s arms. “Are you Sirius Black?” Barty Crouch, Sr. asks. Sirius stares at him. A murmur washes over the crowd when Sirius doesn’t reply. He doesn’t know what would come out if opens his mouth. Maybe a scream. A curse. Most likely, he’d probably find that his voice is completely gone, just another thing he lost in the blaze of inferno. His tongue used to belong in between Remus’ teeth. No. He isn’t thinking about Remus. No. “Are you Sirius Black?” Barty Crouch, Sr. asks again. Sirius stares at him. Barty Crouch, Sr. sighs. “Did you sell James and Lily Potter out to Voldemort, Mr. Black?”Sirius stares at him. “Did you kill Peter Pettigrew?”Sirius stares at him. “Did you kill twelve muggles in the process of murdering Peter Pettigrew, who was just a boy—”“He was just a boy,” Sirius croaks. It’s the first time he speaks in three days. Barty Crouch, Sr. pauses, eyes wide, but Sirius no longer cares about him. His eyes are on Dumbledore, and Dumbledore alone. “James was just a boy,” Sirius repeats. Dumbledore’s eyes go wide, maybe as though he’s afraid, though Sirius can’t really tell and can’t honestly say he cares. He thinks about how when Snape got past the Whomping Willow, Sirius was just a little disappointed that the tree didn’t decapitate his fucking head off. He thinks about how he was the one to cut Peter’s pinky finger off. He thinks about how the first time he used a Crucatious curse he was five and it was on his own brother, who writhed and screamed and begged him to stop, his mother’s hand resting gently on his shoulder. There was always a lingering darkness within Sirius. Something he chose to ignore. But he looks at Dumbledore and he remembers the war and he remembers the start and he remembers the end and he remembers that if he had a knife sharp enough right now he would gouge Dumbledore’s eyeballs from his fucking skull for everyone to see. He clenches his fist and tries to recall how Regulus’ dagger felt in his hands.A figure moves from behind Dumbledore. Short, portly, with cropped, tawny blond hair. An upturned nose, rosy cheeks and bright blue eyes. He has the build of a Pettigrew and the features to match and Sirius doesn’t think, doesn’t even breath before he’s running towards the crowd and leaping at the man. He doesn’t need a knife for this. There are screams and cries and someone points a wand that Sirius grabs and stabs into Pettigrew’s eye, blood spurting out in chunks over the dark stone seats. Pettigrew howls and Dumbledore tries to haul Sirius away, but Sirius doesn’t remember being a person with mercy, so he digs his nails in and splits Pettigrew’s cheek and he rips a chunk of tawny blond hair out his head so hard that it bleeds. When Pettigrew dies, he dies a mess of sinew and sticky blood, splattered across the courtroom like a spectacle. In the end, it wasn’t Peter Pettigrew that was lingering in the crowd. It was Peter’s brother. Sirius spits on his body regardless as he’s being dragged out of the courtroom, and when he looks up, Professor McGonagall has the look of a woman who’s seen unspeakable horrors. Sirius’ nose aches where an Auror hit him, so he can’t really see through the watering of his own eyes, but he doesn’t need to see to know her hands are shaking. Sirius laughs and shows off the blood coating his teeth. He doesn’t get a trial in the end. They throw him into an empty cell in Azkaban and Sirius curls into himself on the cold, frigid floors, waiting to rot.  — James Potter’s body is cold when Sirius arrives at the scene. He only gets to hold James for a few moments before he’s snatched away, but in those few, measly moments, James’ body is cold. The dagger in Sirius’ pocket feels heavy. They cart James and Lily off in separate cots, a white sheet draped over their bodies, and for a brief, delirious second, Sirius thinks, don’t. Just that. Don’t. James wasn’t supposed to die. Sirius would have rathered anyone to die than James. James should’ve lived. Not Lily, not Harry, not even Remus. Just James. Sirius was prepared for all of their deaths, anticipated and even expected them. But not James. Never James. On the Christmas of their third year, James had written Sirius a letter that he never read, because his mother burned it before he could even touch it. When they came back from the holidays, Sirius pulled James aside and asked what he wrote to him. James had smiled, brilliant, cheeky, tongue-in-cheek, and said, I called you a wanker four times in that letter and demanded chocolate frogs in turn for our continued friendship. Sirius knew he was lying, but he smiled anyway, laughing and shoving James away. The winter Sirius ran away from home, James had wrapped him in blankets and wiped the blood splatters from his cheeks and admitted, I wrote you that letter because I was worried about you. The letter your mother burned in our third year. I wrote it to ask if you were okay. And Sirius had cried and sobbed and emptied himself dry and James held him all throughout, stroking softly through his hair, and when Sirius was hollow and the blood was dry under his fingernails, James helped him to the bathroom and washed his hands for him. There isn’t any blood when James dies. There is no massacre. No violence. Just a body, an empty hand where his wand should’ve been. They don’t let Sirius see Harry. Not even to hold him. He begs just to kiss the top of his head, but they refuse him. Maybe they’re right to do that. Because Sirius looks at Harry and sees James and sees Lily and sees the blood oozing from the scar on his forehead and looks down at his hands to find no blood. James didn’t bleed out. He was simply killed. He simply died. He can’t remember leaving Godric’s Hollow. He can’t remember scouring the streets looking for Peter, and he can’t remember finding him. It’s all just a blank.Sirius comes back to himself with his dagger to Peter’s throat. “Please,” Peter wheezes under him. He’s shaking, eyes wide, face pale. The dagger bleeds where it’s digging into his skin. “You killed James,” Sirius hisses, “and you think I’ll show you mercy?”“I didn’t mean to!” Peter cries. Maybe he’s right. Maybe Peter was coerced into violence, that he really didn’t mean to kill James and Lily, except James’ body is growing colder in a morgue and Peter is the direct cause of that, so Sirius doesn’t actually give a fuck whether or not he meant to. He doesn’t care if Peter didn’t have a choice, he doesn’t care that it’s a war and all any of them are trying to do is survive. James is dead. And Sirius will make Peter live to regret that decision. There are witnesses. Sirius can see them out of the corner of his eye. But if this is a show, he’ll make sure it’s worth watching. Sirius doesn’t kill Peter immediately. He wants to make Peter beg for his life just to kill him anyway, so he drags the dagger down to Peter’s hand and chops his pinky finger clean off. Peter screams bloody murder and Sirius remembers in that moment something Remus once told him during lunch, back when they were still in Hogwarts. Pinky fingers hold the whole hand together, he had said. If it’s taken off for any reason, the whole hand falls apart. You lose almost fifty percent of your grip strength if you lose your pinky. Did you know that?Sirius knows that now, and bless Remus for that information. He watches Peter’s hand twitch and bleed out from the severed pinky and thinks about how he should cut off the ring finger, too. Make sure that Peter can’t grab his wand. But before he can even raise his dagger back up, Peter wriggles out from under him. Which shouldn’t be possible. Except in Sirius’ blind rage he forgot that the fucking traitor is also an animagus, the smallest creature, a rat, and how fitting, too. He leaves an explosion behind, one that knocks Sirius so fack back that he goes unconscious, pain blooming in the nape of his neck. In the wake of it, Sirius blinks his eyes open and finds himself surrounded by twelve dead muggles and the stench of rot, no Peter in sight. He cradles his hands into his chest and wishes, wishes, wishes, he wishes there was blood.  — Remus is not the traitor. Remus is the traitor. Sirius paces and wears craters into the floor of their studio apartment from his pacing and mulls the evidence over in his head. Remus is gone longer than he is here. Remus keeps secrets now, secrets that nobody knows, secrets that don’t see the light of day but Sirius knows they’re there, a lingering shadow in their small, honest home. Remus doesn’t sleep anymore. He wakes up screaming into Sirius’ chest and he doesn’t cry when it’s over, just turns away and pretends to fall asleep again. He has shadows under his eyes and he’s half the weight he was when this started. He doesn’t want to have sex. He barely kisses Sirius at all. He’s beautiful. He’s just so fucking beautiful. If Remus is the traitor, Sirius may end the world. He may tear it apart with his hands. He may dig into his own flesh and pull his heart out of his chest, arteries attached, and throw it at Remus just to watch his blood coat Remus’ cheek. He can’t stand watching Remus covered with blood that doesn’t belong to him. Only I can touch him, the snarling monster within him hisses. I’m the only one he’s allowed to hurt. Except it’s not like that anymore, is it? Before, Sirius didn’t mind living in oblivion. He didn’t mind that Remus may have betrayed him, may have turned his back on the one thing Sirius thought they shared. He didn’t mind it, because before, the betrayal belonged to Sirius and Sirius alone. But now James and Lily are in hiding. They soothe an infant Harry to sleep in their solitude home, that place they were exiled to, the west country of England, because safety isn’t in numbers anymore but in distance. There’s this messy knot in Sirius’ chest now. A voice in his head. A lump in his throat. It feels and sounds and tastes like, don’t touch Remus. He’s mine. Don’t touch James. He’s mine. Don’t touch me. I’m theirs. Don’t come any closer. It’s so sticky in Sirius’ hands, all these ugly half-truths. He doesn’t want Remus to hurt anyone but Sirius. He doesn’t want James to get hurt at all. He doesn’t want them in danger, and he knows that they have to be, knows that he would kill anyone in a heartbeat for them. Knows that he would kill any one of them for the other. He doesn’t want to have that choice. He thinks maybe he’s already made it. Sirius paces. He thinks. He waits. Hours later, when the sky’s creeping closer to sunrise, their front door opens. Remus walks in, dragging his feet, back hunched. He has a new cut on his cheek. His nose is broken and bleeding. Every time he breathes in, it sounds wet with blood. Sirius stops pacing and watches Remus straighten, set his rucksack down, and walk into the kitchen to get a glass of water. Sirius doesn’t speak. He goes to the bathroom and starts preparing the gauze, takes out the blood replenishing potions and takes stock of their Skele-gro. Remus follows him soon after, sits on the toilet with barely a wince and hangs his head down. This is who they are now. They don’t speak. They don’t touch. They sleep in the same bed at different times and wake up only when the other is already gone. This is what war does to love. It turns it ugly. It makes it cruel. Sirius heals Remus’ nose and ribs and he gives him potions that he drinks with a grimace and then he sits back, on the floor with his back on the wall, and waits. He doesn’t heal Remus’ cut. Remus likes the pain and Sirius thinks he deserves it. “I’m sorry,” Remus chokes out. Sirius freezes. Remus’ voice feels foreign, sounds different, a month of space between now and the last time he heard Remus speak. There’s gravel in his throat that makes him sound raspy. It sounds painful. It sounds like he’s choking on his own blood.“I know it’s hard to see me like this and not know what caused it,” Remus continues, looking down at his hands. He’s picking at the calluses on his fingers, and Sirius watches him, waiting for them to bleed. “I know that I’m a violent man, and I know that you know that and you heal me anyway. I know that you’re a violent man, too. I know how hard it is to do this for me.”Sirius swallows. He can’t speak. He can’t move. “I wish I were better, but— but I’m not.”“I don’t want you to be better,” Sirius admits before he can help it. His voice sounds foreign to his own ears. He hasn’t spoken to anyone in a few days, so it comes out a croak, but Sirius doesn’t clear his throat. Let Remus see. Let Remus see what they’ve become.  Remus looks up. The whites of his eyes are yellowing, deep and ugly, but his irises are still that golden-amber colour, the one that looks like honey in the right light. His eyes don’t fill with tears — Sirius doesn’t expect them to — but they get close. Glassy. “I like you like this,” Sirius adds, a hoarse whisper. It’s a confession as much as a reassurance. I like you as you are. I like you violent. I like you hurt. Remus looks away. The muscle of his jaw twitches as he clenches it. “Have you heard from James or Lily yet?” he asks. “No, not yet.”Remus nods, and then— and then he crawls down to Sirius and crouches down in front of him. He’s holding back winces, Sirius can tell, and his joints crack when he bends them too fast. He doesn’t point it out. “I know I make it hard to be around me,” Remus says, his hand coming on top of Sirius’ knee. “That’s my own doing, really. But I just— can I—”Sirius knows what Remus is trying to ask for. But he stays silent anyway, waiting, watching Remus stumble over his words, even though it breaks something inside of him not to reach out and pull Remus into his arms. He wants to touch Remus, too, but there’s distance now. Distance Sirius would rather die than breach first. His desire and his pride war over each other, and Remus struggles in front of him just the same, teeth clenched tight. Remus tugs Sirius’ sleeve, pulls him closer until their knees touch, and then he tugs harder. Sirius loses his balance and nearly topples on top of Remus, but Remus catches his arm and tips his head up with his fingers. “Please,” Remus whispers. Their faces are inches apart. “Please, Sirius.”Desire wins out. Sirius pushes forward and cradles Remus’ face in his hands, pulls him in for a kiss even when their teeth clash. There’s a learning curve, an awkward stumble where Remus and Sirius aren’t melting into each other as they should, but then Remus grabs Sirius’ waist and hoists him into his lap, and Sirius gives in. He cards his fingers through Remus’ hair and he nibbles at his bottom lip and in his head he prays, let this be my last night. Let me die here, while he’s still holding me. Let his lips be the last thing I feel. Remus lays Sirius down on their bathroom floor and crowds up on top of him, not once breaking the kiss. Remus kisses like he breathes, like he kills, like he wants his lips to be blood-red by the end of it. He uses too much tongue and he doesn’t come up for air even when he’s panting. It’s a little too wet and slippery, a little too much to be anything at all, but it’s a kiss. It’s Remus’ bottom lip between Sirius’ teeth. Remus kisses and kisses and kisses him and he does it all with his hand up Sirius’ shirt. Sirius wraps his legs around Remus’ hips and pushes him down, pushes up into him, chasing something that’s just out of reach even though there’s at least two layers of fabric between them. He’s just a little too desperate for it and a little too ruined to hide it. Remus shushes him softly, little cooing noises, trailing his lips down Sirius’ neck. Sirius’ shirt comes off and Remus’ shirt comes half-off and neither of them pay any mind to the hanging fabric, because Remus’ tongue trails down Sirius’ chest and fuck the shirt, actually. Sirius grabs onto the closest part of Remus — his shoulders, his neck — and he digs his nails so hard that he’s scared his fingernails might break skin. Remus makes a muffled noise into Sirius’ sternum that he feels reverberate through him like a sonic boom. Right now they’re nothing but physics and chemistry and biology. Need and need and need. When Remus is too far down to grab onto anymore, Sirius grapples for the next best thing. The walls. The tiles. The edge of the shower floor behind them. He shoves his fist in his hand and bites so hard he tastes blood. Moans into it. When Remus comes back up, he pulls Sirius’ hand out of his mouth and replaces it with two of his fingers. They were never like this in Hogwarts. They were gentler. Easier. They laughed more and they would crack jokes in between blowjobs and there was a learning curve much bigger than this one, but neither of them were frustrated by it. It was exciting, and a little daunting, but it was mostly fun. This isn’t fun. Fun implies that it’s not a necessity to their very functioning, and that’s simply not true anymore. Maybe it was fun before. Maybe it was something they wanted to do. But Sirius kisses Remus and takes his shirt off properly and shoves his hands in the back of his trousers and it’s no longer something that Sirius simply wants. He needs this. He needs. “Sirius,” Remus pants, tears in his eyes. Sirius shakes his head. He bites Remus’ shoulder and whimpers when he feels where Remus’ finger is trailing, his vision nearly whiting out. Remus pushes in slowly, slower than Sirius would like, so Sirius wraps his legs around Remus and drags him close by the heels, hard enough that Remus seems to take the hint. Sirius, in some masochistic way, wants this to hurt. He wants the evidence that they ended up here even after Remus goes away again. He wants this to be irreversible.  And Sirius cries. He cries and he sobs and he begs Remus and Remus coaxes it out of him firmly, gently, and Sirius thinks, damn you, Remus, you traitor, you cunt, you’re going to have me killed. You’re going to kill me. You’re going to kill all of us. You’re going to get yourself killed and I will never, I will never forgive you for it. If you die I will burn the world down and I will spell your name in the ashes. You traitor. Don’t be a traitor. Please be a traitor if it keeps you safe. I can forgive you if you're alive. You traitor. Don’t touch James. I love you. You traitor. What neither of them say is that Remus gets off on this just as much as Sirius does. They both harbour an unhealthy obsession with one another. They both bite too hard and leave marks where anyone can see. They’re both maniacal and batshit crazy. They’re both in love. Sirius screams when it’s over. He breaks down into sobs. He thinks he may need this, maybe even deserves this, and Remus gathers him in his arms and holds him, kisses the top of his head in sporadic little bursts that make it easier to breathe. When Remus buries his face into Sirius’ hair, he can feel the tears there. Remus is trembling, too. They’re both trembling in time with one another.Remus cleans Sirius with a cloth and warm water and Sirius slumps, tired, pressing occasional, grateful kisses to Remus’ shoulder. And then they go to bed, side by side. Remus’ head on Sirius’ chest. When Sirius wakes up the next day, he wakes up alone.  — The first time Sirius killed something, he was seven. It was a bird. An owl. It got sick, too sick to fly, though his parents didn’t care about that. Nobody could figure out what was wrong with it, but Sirius guessed that it was probably because his mother would use Cruciatus curse on it whenever it didn’t deliver a letter on time. She was a very exacting woman, Walburga Black. If the owl didn’t come back on time, she would hex it and sometimes she would make Sirius and Regulus stand in a line and watch. Birds cry, too, apparently. They scream. Sirius didn’t want to know that but he does. There was a day where Regulus and Sirius were home alone for some reason or another, and the owl came back from delivering a letter, its wing bent awkwardly and broken. It didn’t even make it to the window. It just collapsed in their garden, letting out little cries of help. Sirius and Regulus ran to the garden, but it was too late and the bird was clearly dying. Its bone was poking out, and it was bleeding out onto the grass like a little massacre, the first sign of war. Sirius didn’t love the bird. It didn’t even have a name — Walburga didn’t want them to get attached to it. He didn’t love the bird, but he cared for it. He cared that it was in pain when it didn’t deserve it. Birds don’t know anything about war. They don’t know how to start one. They just are, until they bleed out onto the grass of someone’s house, and then they aren’t anymore. Sirius remembers how Regulus tried to pick the owl up and how it shrieked, flapping its good wing and trying to bite Regulus’ fingers off. Sirius had to pull Regulus away before the bird did any damage no matter how much he struggled. Regulus threw up in a nearby bush, and when he came back, he did it trembling. The first Avada Kedavra Sirius ever used was on that bird. He didn’t want it to be in pain any longer, but more importantly, he didn’t want his mother to return and heal the owl’s broken arm just to put it through more hell. It deserves peace. Even now, looking back on it, Sirius doesn’t know whether he was the one to give it that.When his wand flashed green, Sirius flinched. Regulus didn’t, his face stoic but pale. Sirius didn’t shed a tear. Regulus didn’t either, at least not initially, but he crawled into Sirius’ bed in the middle of the night and sobbed, and Sirius pretended to be asleep so he wouldn’t have to give him a hug. The owl isn’t Sirius’ last kill, but it is his first, and that feels important enough to note down with the way Sirius has been acting lately. The war takes more blood than most of them thought it would. Sirius remembers how excited they were to make a difference. To be on the good side. James had grinned all throughout their first Order meeting. It feels almost laughable now, how naive they were even just a year ago. They were so fucking stupid. Now, things are different. Now, Regulus is dead. James doesn’t smile anymore. Lily is pregnant and snappy and fucking mean, which Sirius can appreciate in a time like this. Remus is becoming distant. Peter doesn’t look them in the eye anymore. And Sirius is the most brutal Order member the world has ever seen. Nobody talks to him anymore. They flinch when he moves too fast. He and Fabian went on a mission once, something that was supposed to be simple and ended up not, and when they came back Fabian had put himself in front of Gideon as if Sirius was going to kill them, too. Sirius knows what death feels like. It’s covered in blood. It makes squelching noises and it chokes on itself. The only person that doesn’t seem to flinch at the blood on his hands is Dumbledore. He sends Sirius on every possible mission and because it’s Dumbledore, nobody questions his authority. So Sirius goes and he murders and he rages and ravages and he comes back covered in blood. Dumbledore does nothing. He lets Sirius roam free like the savage dog he is. It’s Peter’s turn to go on a mission with Sirius now. Because that’s how they do it. They have to take turns babysitting Sirius lest he raises hell on any motherfucker who stands in his way, because that’s the compromise McGonagall and Dumbledore came to when they were still deciding what to do with Sirius. The whole thing is a little insulting, but not unprecedented. Sirius feels a little as though he unravels more and more every time he kills someone, waiting for the final string to come undone and reveal the black, hideous core of him. The Black in him. The horror he inherited from his mother. The mission is simple, as they always start as: Peter and Sirius have to clear out a safehouse in Amsterdam, because there’s a rumour circulating that the Death Eaters know its location now. It’s full of displaced muggleborns, and it’s vital that all of them survive. That’s what Kingsley says, at least. Sirius wouldn’t necessarily say it’s vital, per say. Though nothing to him is vital anymore. His brother is dead. That’s all there is, now. It’s mostly a stealth mission. They sneak into the safehouse from the back and start clearing it out one by one using portable Portkeys. Children first. Sick and wounded second. The rest last. Sirius sees a child with black hair and blue eyes scribbling on a piece of burnt parchment and gets her out first. It doesn’t matter that she has pigtails and cries when she has to leave her mother. She looks like Regulus, so Sirius gets her out first. It’s as they’re clearing out the last of the people that Sirius hears a hiss from outside. “Do you hear that?” Peter whispers.Sirius holds a hand up. He makes his way to the window and crouches down just enough to see outside. In the distance, he can make out the army of Death Eaters approaching, at least a dozen of them, all wearing ink-black robes and dark, silver masks. At their forefront is a snake, big enough to intimidate. Small enough to kill. “Get the rest out,” Sirius hisses, grabbing his wand. Peter immediately starts ushering people to the Portkey, ten at a time even though it’s dangerous, and Sirius makes his way down the stairs and out the back, slowly. He’s good at this part. The quiet beforehand. Maybe even better than the killing, because he grew up in a house with Walburga Black for a mother — he knows how to sneak around. The Death Eaters are quick, but Sirius is quicker. He kills three men without his wand and two with it in under a minute. One tries to sneak up on him and Sirius snaps his neck clean. It makes an ugly crack, something that should chill Sirius down to his bones. Not invigorate him. The sound shouldn’t make a delighted shiver crawl up his spine. Sirius wasn’t always this ruthless. When Regulus was alive, he never hurt Death Eaters more than what could be salvaged, just in case. Just in case it was his little brother behind the mask. But now Regulus is dead, gone somewhere even Sirius can’t reach, so he doesn’t care to be careful anymore. These were the people that had Regulus’ back, that were supposed to make sure he was safe. Once, that was Sirius’ job. But neither of them could keep Regulus from harm, and so Sirius turns his anger to the people responsible: Death Eaters. Voldemort. Himself, though he can’t do much about that, can he? He can kill and kill and kill and it won’t make the fact that Sirius couldn’t save Regulus any less true, won’t make the fact that Regulus died at eighteen years old just shy of his birthday, alone and probably scared, in a position he never should have been in. Of the two of them, Regulus was the better person. Sirius can admit that. He loved their mother even though she didn’t deserve it, and he loved Sirius even though he probably didn’t deserve it, either. He made the decisions he made because he cared. Sirius would even bet his life on the fact that Regulus died because he cared too much. Sirius doesn’t care. Not enough to stop. Eventually it’s just Sirius and one Death Eater. Sirius cracks his neck and lunges before the Death Eater can so much as think to run away. He slams the Death Eater to the ground and stabs the person’s own dagger through their leg. The cry the Death Eater lets out is eerily familiar, and yet Sirius doesn’t care, dragging the blade through muscle all the way down the top of the knee joint. “Are there more Death Eaters coming?” Sirius seethes. “Fuck you,” the Death Eater spits, so Sirius pushes down on the blade until their knee cap is just about to pop off. There are more screams, more cries, and Sirius doesn’t care. “Are there more Death Eaters coming?” Sirius asks again, a bite to his tone. This time, the Death Eater doesn’t respond, too busy grappling with their mask, and when they finally get it undone and pull it away, Sirius nearly freezes. Nearly. It’s Evan Rosier. His face is pale, paler than usual, yellowing quicker the more blood he loses, and his head is bleeding where it slammed to the ground. His eyes flicker to Sirius and there’s a desperation there, a miserable sort of pleading, as though he knows it will be pointless but he will try anyway. Evan Rosier once belonged to Regulus. Which makes Sirius hesitate. But then he remembers that the man before him was meant to be Regulus’ best friend, was meant to protect him, and somehow Regulus still died and that’s— that’s on him. He yanks the dagger out roughly and revels in the way Evan screams himself bloody hoarse. “I’m sorry—” Evan groans, tears in his eyes. “I’m sorry, please, Sirius. Don’t— don’t kill me. I just— please, Sirius, please.”Sirius picks up the dagger. Evan’s dagger, apparently, except Sirius recognises the carving on the handle. He remembers giving this to Regulus when they were kids, just in case. He had bought it with his own money, bits and pieces that he was stealing little by little so that his mother wouldn’t notice any of her money was gone. It’s a piece of Regulus Sirius never thought would return to him, and yet here is it, in the palm of his hands. He lifts the dagger up. “No, no, no, no, listen!” Evan screams, trying to push himself up. Sirius watches with cool disinterest, dagger still raised. “Listen, that— that was Regulus’ knife. It was his. He gave it to me. He— he told me to protect it.”Sirius hums. “Really?” he drawls sarcastically. Evan nods. “Yeah, yeah, it is. It’s his. You— you can take it. It’s yours. Just please, please don’t— don’t do this. Regulus wouldn’t have wanted this.”\nDon’t tell me what he would have wanted. I know that better than you. I know he would hate me for this.\n“Regulus is dead,” Sirius hisses. “I’m sorry,” Evan sobs. “I know, I know, I’m sorry. Please, please, just— just let me go, please. I won’t tell anyone. I won’t— Sirius, please— you weren’t like this before he died, you weren’t— please, Sirius, please, I’m begging you—”“Are you done?”“I just want to go home,” Evan cries. “I just— please, Sirius, no, no, no—”Sirius drives the knife into Evan’s throat before he can even finish pleading for his life. Evan is right— was right. Sirius wasn’t like this before Regulus died. His murder sprees started a month after Regulus was confirmed dead, and before that, he had barely killed anything at all. Just that owl, really. Sirius pulls the dagger out of Evan’s throat. Wipes the blood on his trousers and then pockets the dagger. Vows to keep it with him at all times. He gets up and turns around to find Peter standing there, eyes wide. What a sight Sirius must be, then, covered in blood, surrounded by bleeding bodies. There’s a man still twitching in the corner, paralyzed. Sirius is quite sure he’ll be dead in two minutes. Despite the shock on his face, Peter doesn’t look scared. He looks… apprehensive, maybe. Cautious. Something else that isn’t either of those things but that Sirius doesn’t have the capacity to name at the moment. “Did you get everybody out?” Sirius asks. Peter nods, and that’s that. They go home. He’ll find out years down the line that it wasn’t just apprehension and caution on Peter’s face. It was also a realisation. He’ll find out in some nebulous point in the future that two weeks after Sirius killed Evan, Peter had joined Voldemort’s ranks and became a spy for the order. He’ll find out, but not before James’ body falls, already dead before he hits the ground.  — They don’t find Regulus’ body. At first, that fills Sirius with hope. If there’s no body, then he can’t be dead. Just missing. Gone. Not yet found, and maybe never found. Sirius hopes and hopes and hopes and feels stupid for hoping the longer the weeks drag on. But Regulus might still be alive. He might’ve just ran away. Merlin, Sirius hopes he just ran away. James helps. He stays on Sirius and Remus’ couch and cooks meals when Remus is gone on mission, coaxes Sirius into showers and makes sure he brushes his teeth. If it weren’t for James, Sirius would probably rot in his bed, but James would never allow that. The weeks stretch on. Sirius grows more and more catatonic and James doesn’t leave, and sometimes Remus is there and sometimes he isn’t and Sirius loves him, he loves this man with a conviction like no other, but he can’t be a person who’s easy to love back right now. He is not a lover anymore, or a friend. Just a brother. When the three week mark hits and there’s still no sign of Regulus, the Daily Prophet declares Regulus presumed to be dead. Sirius burns every edition he can find and nearly lights their coffee table on fire. Regulus Black: presumed to be dead. If they do find a body, would there be a funeral? Would Sirius be allowed to attend? He doesn’t think he’d want to, or that he should, because it’s his little brother, little Reggie. Regulus used to cry whenever Sirius killed bugs and cried when Sirius caught them instead to release them back out. Sirius remembers being so annoyed at Regulus for crying about something so stupid, especially because he’d seen Regulus take worse for less. He remembers berating Regulus for crying when they had to let go of a spider. It’s just a bloody bug, Sirius had sighed, and Regulus had wiped his tears away roughly and turned away from Sirius. Sirius was so fucking stupid. He should’ve given Regulus a hug. Should’ve comforted him. Maybe then, Regulus wouldn’t be missing/presumed to be dead. A month passes by, and Sirius gets a letter. He doesn’t get to see the owl that delivered it, but there are little blood splatters where its nails were digging into the letter, so he knows before he even reads the return address that it came from his mother. The letter, which Sirius rips open with tremors in his hands, is quite straightforward.  \nSirius Orion Black,\n\nThe Noble and Most Ancient House of Black expresses our greatest sorrow to inform you that Regulus Arcturus Black is confirmed dead. His date of death has made itself known on the Black tapestry in 12 Grimmauld Place, 23-29 Claremont Square, Islington, London on the 28th of November, 1979. As there is no body to be found and buried, there will be no funeral, but there will be a wake on the 4th of December should you choose to attend. \n\nAll the best, \n\nThe Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. \n Sirius reads the letter again, and again, and again, and then he checks the calendar on the wall that reads December 21st, 1979. This must be a mistake. This— this— he can’t be— Regulus isn’t—“Padfoot?”Sirius looks up from the letter and finds that he can’t see James properly through his tears. “It says he’s dead,” Sirius croaks, and then he crumbles to the ground. James has to gather the remains of Sirius in his arms and hold him, but Sirius doesn’t sob. He registers the tears absentmindedly streaming down his face, and he thinks he may be shaking, but he can’t really feel it. He can’t really feel anything anymore. He thinks the part of him that was human was a brother, and now he isn’t. He isn’t a brother anymore. Regulus is dead. He’s been dead for a month, and Sirius didn’t know. Shouldn’t he have felt it? Shouldn’t he have known that Regulus was gone the moment he passed away? Sirius always thought that when the time came, he would know. But even now, even with the confirmation crushed in his hand, he can’t really believe it. Regulus Black is dead. Regulus is dead. Little Reggie is dead. The days pass on and Sirius does nothing. He tries to wrap his head around the words Regulus is dead and finds that he can’t manage it, because how, how is Regulus dead? He was right here. They played in the snow together just yesterday. Didn’t Sirius just give Regulus the last slice of pizza? It all feels close enough to touch. Sirius reaches his hand out into the empty space and can almost feel his fingers carding through Regulus’ hair. He was just here, wasn’t he? He was. Except Sirius hasn’t properly talked to Regulus since graduating from Hogwarts. Years down the line, Sirius will find that he can’t remember most of his grieving process, save for one day. It happens two days after Christmas. Sirius is left home alone for some reason or another, but he can’t really remember why. James said he was going to get food, so maybe it’s that? Except James could have said that days ago and Sirius wouldn’t have noticed. Where is James? Remus? Sirius wants to go check for them, but he doesn’t think he can’t. He wants to see the tapestry. He wants to see the confirmation right before his eyes.Sirius is apparating to Grimmauld Place before he can think better of it. When he lands with a heavy thud, Sirius looks up. The house looms over him like a premonition, dark and imposing, black brick that reeks of dark magic. All the curtains are shut, and it’s dark, all dark. Sirius didn’t realise it was nighttime. How long has he been waiting for this? What is he doing here? He shouldn’t be here, his mother might see, he might put Regulus in— oh. Regulus is dead. Regulus is dead. He’s no longer in danger. Sirius doesn’t have to care anymore. A figure peaks out from one of the windows, who Sirius recognises as Kreacher. He slips away before Sirius can get a good look, though. Sirius picks himself up and dusts off his pyjamas. On shaky feet, he starts walking to the front door. He doesn’t bother knocking — Kreacher probably told Walburga that he’s here, so he might as well do as he fucking please. He opens the door and walks in, making a beeline for the living room. “Sirius.”He freezes. Orion is slumped on one of the arm chairs. His previously black hair is streaked with grey now, and where he was once large and imposing, he is now hunched, thinner, frail. His cheeks are sunken in. There are deep bags under his eyes. Beside the arm chair he’s sitting in is an intravenous pole, an IV bag hanging off of it. He’s not wearing the typical suit and tie Sirius remembers him constantly wearing, even in the house. Instead, he’s in a plain shirt and pyjama pants. The sight is so jarring that Sirius blinks, trying to remember where he is. “Father,” Sirius bites out. “You should find yourself lucky that your mother isn’t home today,” Orion muses blithely. “She would’ve had your head on a platter.”Sirius inhales. “Where is Regulus?” Orion gives him a look that could be akin to pity, except Sirius has never seen pity on his father’s face before, so he doesn’t know what it actually looks like. “Regulus is—”Dead. Oh. Yeah, he is. “The tapestry, I mean,” Sirius corrects. He’s surprised by the strength of his own voice. Orion gestures vaguely to the wall in front of him, “Go ahead. You remember where his name is, yes? I won’t get up to show you if you forgot.Sirius doesn’t answer. He walks up to the tapestry and traces the names, following the branches down to the recent generation of children. Narcissa. Bellatrix. The scorch mark where Andy used to be. The scorch mark where Sirius used to be. Sirius touches his own name, the place where it says 1959– and no death date. He moves on. He finds Regulus easily. He’s the only one out of the cousins with a skull instead of a face. Sirius swallows, looking at the inscription. \nRegulus II. 1961-1979.\nRegulus is dead. Regulus is dead. Regulus is dead. Regulus is—“Found him?” Orion asks. Sirius swallows. He turns slowly to Orion, something thrumming in his veins that he doesn’t understand, but it doesn’t scare him. “He never should have died,” Sirius whispers, eyes burning with tears. Orion clicks his tongue, shaking his head. “He wouldn’t have, if you had taken the Dark Mark instead. It’s a shame, really, that the wrong son died, but maybe it was for the best. He was pathetic sometimes. Defending you when he could. I pity him for ever having loved you.”Sirius doesn’t know what happens next. All he knows is that one moment, he’s pulling his wand out, and then he blinks, and he’s covered in blood. Where Orion sat not even a moment ago is now a display of torn muscles, tangled organs, shreds of skin hanging off the bones, dripping red. Ligaments and tissue hang off every surface as if this place is a slaughterhouse and not a living room, a squelching, rotting carnage. His skull is smashed in, and the mush that once used to be his brain drips out slowly, drip, drip drip. A bloodbath. Decimation. It is the brutalist of executions. There’s not even a body to salvage, not even a finger left untouched in the wake of it all. A wild animal has torn Orion Black apart. Sirius stares down at his hands. There’s blood under his fingernails where his claws are retracing. He touches a hand to his hair and they come back crimson with blood. He rolls his neck and it feels stiff, the same way it always feels when he transforms back from Padfoot. He is covered head to toe in blood. A wild animal has torn Orion Black apart. He picks up the nearest part of Orion — it looks like it used to be his liver. Flesh feels soggy, Sirius notes, when saturated with blood. Sirius drops the pound of flesh and doesn’t flinch when it falls with an ugly splat. A gasp comes from behind him. Sirius whirls around and finds James standing by the door, frozen. “Sirius, what did you do?” James curses. “I don’t know,” Sirius says, or at least he thinks so, because he can’t actually hear his own voice. He’s not even sure he spoke aloud to begin with. He looks back at the bloodshed. Can’t tear his eyes away, really. He did that to a person. He did that to his father. “Sirius, hey, hey. Look at me. Look at me.” When Sirius doesn’t look up from the massacre that used to be his father, James grabs him by the face and forces their eyes to meet. “Sirius, you need to breathe.”Sirius isn’t breathing. His vision is starting to fray at the edges, oxygen deprivation, but his lungs refuse to work. He thinks he might be gasping. He thinks he might be dying. In all the duration of the war, Sirius hasn’t killed a single person. Not one. And now his father is unrecognisable. James grips Sirius and apparates them back to his apartment. Not Sirius and Remus’ apartment, Sirius notes, stumbling. No, James’ home. James sits Sirius down on the couch and doesn’t seem to mind that he’s getting blood everywhere, spreading it around like a disease. Sirius curls into himself and tries to remember how to make his lungs work again. James apparates away with a click, not even a goodbye. Sirius would be worried, but this is James’ apartment. He has to come back at some point. James is gone. Regulus is dead. Sirius— Sirius killed—Regulus. Sirius killed Regulus. Sirius killed someone that had Regulus’ nose, had his hair and his jaw and his smile. Regulus is dead. Sirius couldn’t save him, couldn’t get him out, didn’t even try to get him out. Regulus was always the smarter one out of the both of them, and now he’s dead. Sirius might as well have killed him. Regulus is dead. He’s dead.He’s dead. Regulus is dead. When James comes back in the early morning light, blood smudged against the front of his shirt, Sirius still hasn’t moved from where he’s curled up on the couch. The blood is sticky now, drying to his clothes and hair, making them stiff. Sirius watches James wipe the blood from his hand with a kitchen towel calmly, a pensive look on his face. “What…” Sirius begins to ask, and when he can’t find the words, he points at James’ shirt. “I cleaned it up,” James states simply. Sirius doesn’t ask what it is. He nods. James doesn’t flinch when Sirius gets up. He doesn’t move when Sirius approaches him, standing next to him, taking the kitchen towel to clean James’ hands himself. His hands are trembling, but James doesn’t stop him. He just holds his hands out and lets Sirius smear the blood around, making a mess. “Aren’t you scared?” Sirius finds himself asking. “What?”Sirius swallows. “I killed him, James.”“I know.” “Why are you so calm about this?” James pauses, considering, and he states quite plainly. “If your mother were there, I would have killed her for you.” Sirius blinks. He blinks again. He sits with the sentence a little bit, but it doesn’t change. \nIf your mother were there, I would have killed her for you.\n“I’ve hated your parents for as long as I’ve known you, Sirius,” James continues, taking the towel out of Sirius’ hands. “So I can’t say I’m not even the least bit pleased that Orion is dead. I would’ve killed him myself if I had the chance. I would have done the same and maybe more, just for the way he treated you— you and Regulus.”Sirius winces at his brother’s name, but James is undeterred. “I’ve had this image in my head for a while, your mother and father dead and me on the other end of the wand. I would’ve done the same, Sirius.” He shrugs. “So no, I’m not scared.”Sirius nods, he nods and nods and nods and then he starts crying, the first time he can remember doing so since the initial news of Regulus’ death. He lets the tears stream down his face and James stands there and lets him, steady, strong, unbreakable James. Immortal James Potter. Indestructible. When they sleep, it's in the same bed, Sirius curled up as Padfoot in James’ arms.  — The war is gruelling. It’s only the beginning, Sirius knows that. He knows they've seen nothing yet. But it takes more out of him than he realised, more and more and more. He tries to remember what they’re fighting for. He tries to remember that war is good. War is good. That’s what Dumbledore says, at least. War brings change. War is good.  People keep dying all around him. Sirius keeps count. He never wants to be so closed off that death doesn’t hurt. He wants to care, if only for the sake of caring. He wants to care. He does. Caradoc Dearborn is the first to go. There’s no body, nothing to confirm that he’s dead, but when six months past and there isn’t even a whisper in his voice, Dumbledore sighs and tells them all that maybe holding out hope for Dearborn is fruitless. Lily cries, silent tears streaming down her face. James doesn’t speak for the rest of the meeting. Remus squeezes Sirius’ hand under the table, and Sirius swallows down the lump in his throat. The Bones family dies next, and this one is so much more brutal. Edgar Bones, his wife and his three kids are all found dead in their home, bodies already gone cold. Edgar’s face is frozen in a mask of anguish, and there are dried tear tracks on his son’s cheek. The oldest child was ten. The youngest just an infant. Peter and Dorcas are tasked to carry out the bodies, and when they come back, neither of them stay for the briefing. They just leave, silently, and they come back the next day as though nothing is amiss. Benjy Fenwick doesn’t just die; they find his remains scattered across three different rooms, his heart hanging on a pyre in the kitchen. His death wasn’t quick — everyone can tell. There’s an eyeball on the ground. A finger near a chopping board. He didn’t even die in his own home. He died in a safehouse he was supposed to be setting up, a hollow, draughty place. Dumbledore tells the public it was a Blasting curse, and everybody believes him, but Sirius and Lily were the ones to find him. They had to get a bin bag to collect him all. The death that hits the hardest is Marlene and the rest of the McKinnon family. The whole family, once alive, now dead and growing cold. Sirius counts the deaths in his head: Marlene. Her three brothers. Her mother and father. Her uncle. Her aunt-in-law. Their four kids, Marlene’s cousins. Her grandmother. They all die on Boxing Day, screaming in pain and begging for their lives. Lily cries so hard she throws up and Remus doesn’t get out of bed for three days, no matter how much Sirius tries to coax him out. And then Dorcas dies. Now it’s James’ turn not to get out of bed. He was with her on a mission when she snuck off, killing an army of Death Eaters in her wake. It was the first bloody battle of the war, and Dorcas has started it in the name of putting Voldemort’s head on a platter. He had to kill her himself. The last thing she’d ever said was a small, choked Marlene, and then her eyes glazed over and she was dead. James blames himself for it, Sirius knows it. He tries to tell James that there was nothing that could have stopped this, but then he realises that nothing he could say would take away the pain. There’s nothing to do but hold James. So he holds James.  Dougal McGregor is next, the first death after a relatively calm three months. McGregor, his wife and his two children. Graham and Bill. They were twins, and Sirius remembers them being so ridiculously shy. Sirius hasn’t stopped counting, but he doesn’t care as much. He adds four to his mental tally and moves on. Sirius hates all the death, but selfishly, he doesn’t think it’s so bad. James is still here. Remus. Lily. Peter. Even Regulus, who Sirius keeps tabs on occasionally. Yes, Regulus is a Death Eater, yes he kills with ruthlessness Sirius didn’t think he was capable of, but he’s still Sirius’ little brother. He keeps tabs, and secretly, he finds himself a little grateful that Regulus is a Death Eater. The Order members are dropping like flies, and Sirius would rather Regulus be safe than good. He’d rather him evil and alive than noble but dead. Once, Sirius wanted to save the world. Now, he just wants to save his world. His people. He’ll make sure nobody touches them, no harm comes to even a hair on their heads. His mind is now a tirade of chants, over and over and over:\nNot Regulus. \n\nNot Lily. \n\nNot Peter. \n\nNot Remus. \n\nNot James. \nAnyone but them.  — Sirius and Remus get their own studio apartment. It’s a small, bare thing, not entirely furnished and too scarce to be properly livable, but it’s theirs. They’ll make do, together. It’s been a hectic summer. There was apartment hunting and job hunting and saving up money for said apartments, furniture shopping in between nights out at muggle pubs, live music and drinking and dancing. On one such night, James kisses Lily and she kisses him back, both insisting that it was nothing, but James spends the rest of the evening glancing at Lily from the corner of his eye. He used to glance at Regulus like that. Before. In between nights out and moving and dicking around in the London heat, they attend their first Order meeting. It all feels so exciting, saving the world. Fighting evil. Being on the good side. Sirius can’t say that he’s ever been a good person, but maybe this war will get him closer to it.James grins throughout the entirety of their first Order meeting. Sirius doesn’t, but he wants to. Remus makes fun of them both for it later, and Peter laughs. Lily swats them all over the head and tells them that a war is not to be joked about, but Sirius can see her biting back a smile, so it can’t be too bad. Sirius and Remus throw a housewarming party on the last night of the summer. August 31st. It’s mostly them drinking and getting high, Remus passing joints and Sirius pouring wine into everyone’s glasses. Marlene and Dorcas cuddle up on the couch and Mary watches wistfully as Lily and James talk in the corner. Peter does card tricks and beats everyone in chess, always three steps ahead when it matters most. James insists that one day he’ll win against Peter, but they all know that time will never come. They order pizza from somewhere close and practically inhale it. Marlene throws a full slice at Sirius, and it lands on his face with an ugly splat that makes him screech. Everybody laughs. Sirius pouts even though he doesn’t really mind it all. He likes the laughter. He likes that it warms their home a few degrees. “Come here,” Remus murmurs, and Sirius lets him clean the mess of cheese and tomato sauce with a barely-contained grin. When Remus touches him, it feels like a dynamite explosion. Catastrophic. Sirius wants to touch Remus again and again and again and he never wants to stop. Again and again and again.  After, when Sirius’ face is clean, Remus smiles fondly at him and tips his chin up for a kiss. James whoops and Marlene boos and Dorcas and Lily groan and Peter and Mary laugh and Sirius can’t help but giggle into Remus’ lips. Remus pulls away, but Sirius isn’t done. He gives him one, two, three pecks, before pulling away and grinning. The mood doesn’t get solemn intentionally. But the end of the night creeps in, and the wine and weed wear away, they all sit in the living room, smiling at one another, basking in what they must’ve all realised would be their last good day. “Do you think it’ll be okay, in the end?” Marlene asks, her head on Dorcas’ shoulder. “After all this, I mean. After the war. Do you think we’ll all be okay?”James takes Marlene’s hand and squeezes. “Why wouldn’t it be?” he asks, and Marlene looks away, a frown on her face. “I wonder how long the war will last,” Peter muses. Mary shrugs. “Not too long, I hope,” she says, soft, and Lily looks up at her with a reverent look in her eyes. “I want to be able to come back when it’s all over, so don’t make me wait too long, okay? End it all quickly so we can go back to being us.”“I hope it isn’t brutal,” Peter adds. Marlene nods. “Me too. I don’t want to die in some mucky battlefield and leave my brothers behind. I don’t want— I don’t want my parents to have to bury their only daughter.”“You’re not going to die, love,” Dorcas chastises, kissing the top of Marlene’s head. “You won’t. Not if I can help it.”“I just want to see Regulus again,” Sirius admits, because he wants to be able to say it to someone. He wants someone to hold him accountable, make sure he keeps his word when it’s all over. “And keep you all safe. But mostly see Regulus.”“Are you saying you wouldn’t die for me, Pads?” James quips, a hand on his chest. “The betrayal.”Sirius rolls his eyes. “Shut the fuck up.”James laughs, but then his smile turns sad, and he looks at all of them with a melancholic smile on his face. “I would die for you,” James confesses. “All of you. I would die for any one of you in a heartbeat.”“Don’t be morbid, James. None of us are going to die,” Lily admonishes. “Soon the war will be over and it’ll all feel like just one bad dream,” Remus adds, wrapping an arm around Sirius’ shoulders and kissing his temple. Sirius leans into Remus’ warmth and can’t imagine a life where he and Remus are in the same room but not in each other’s arm. “And we’ll all be together?” Sirius asks. James smiles his brilliant, wonderful smile. “We will.”All their guests start filtering out soon after, until it’s just Sirius and Remus, getting ready for bed together, hips knocking as they brush their teeth. Remus holds their blanket open and Sirius crawls into bed, unreasonably excited to wake up with Remus tomorrow. Remus falls asleep first, the moonlight illuminating their room a soft, simple white. Sirius traces the scar on Remus’ chin, softly, careful not to wake him, and Merlin, Remus is beautiful. If Sirius had known how it would’ve all ended, he wouldn’t have let anyone leave the house. He would’ve kept them in the kitchen and he would’ve ordered more pizza and whine and he would’ve— he would’ve dragged their last good day on and on and on, forever, as long as he could manage to get away with. He would’ve kissed Remus a few times more and he would have hugged Lily to his side and held her for as long as she’d allow. He would’ve taken James’ hand, and he would’ve said yes, yes I would die for you, in a heartbeat, in an instant, and even if I don’t die saving you I will die for you. My death belongs to you. If Sirius had known, he would’ve invited Regulus. He would’ve pulled his brother in for a hug and kissed the top of his head, and he would’ve gotten him an owl. He would’ve invited Regulus to stay, and then he would’ve have let him leave. Oh. If only they had known.",
	"45744598000": "“Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do!” Sirius bellows at them as they drive off into the night and head towards the airport. James chuckles and winks at Regulus, who bites his lip and smiles. Barty rolls his eyes and glues his forehead to the window to watch the passing buildings. Gloomy England says its goodbyes to them for two long weeks. Tenerife awaits. Evan has his AirPods in, he’s mindlessly humming to some tune that Barty doesn’t recognise. James and Regulus sprawl in the front seats and whisper sweet nothings to each other. James is driving with one hand and the other draws circles on Reg’s shoulder. Barty relaxes and closes his eyes, tuning out his surroundings. It was a well deserved vacation, long awaited and meticulously planned by control freak Regulus, and funded mostly by James and his ginormous trust fund.  At first, Barty was in two minds about this whole idea, but Evan, slowly but surely, coaxed him into it.“It’s Tenerife. We can do fuck all, lounge about the hotel, stuff our faces, and then go out to get plastered and hit on randomers in bars. Half of the UK population’s going to be there, so you’ll get your pick of pasty white guys, I’m sure of that.” Barty snickers at the memory and peaks at Evan through his eyelashes. His profile is illuminated by the streetlamp lights and he looks serene, immersed in his beloved music, lips moving silently to the lyrics. In the recent months they’ve all been inordinately busy. Barty with his training studio, Evan with his teaching school. They’ve met on occasion, for a beer and a heartfelt chat, and more often than not, a quick fuck on top of the covers, and then in the shower before Evan had to leave for work the next morning, just for good measure. Barty is eternally dumbfounded by their inexplicable ability to keep their friendship intact after their failed attempt at dating, and now, with all this casual sex that just keeps happening. There’s no hard feelings, he assumes, or rather hopes that’s the case. Evan has always worn his heart on his sleeve and never shied away from brutal truths. If Evan had an issue with how they carried on after the breakup, Barty had all the reasons to believe he would have brought it up. But that hasn’t happened yet, and they remain trapped in this cosy, convenient limbo of being… them. The flight is rather uneventful, aside from a snafu with the poor, traumatised flight attendant who has to drag James and Regulus out of the toilet half way through the journey. She refuses to look them in the eye and asks her colleague to attend to them for the rest of the flight. “Fucking mile high club… Really?” Evan scoffs, shaking his head.Regulus sits down next to Barty, looking debauched and dishevelled, sinfully fucked out. Barty squirms in his seat, trying not to stare at his pink cheeks and ruffled hair. He can smell James’ cologne off him, as if James himself was sitting to his right and not across the aisle with Evan. “She totally blueballed us,” Regulus complained, scrunched his pretty nose at the front of the cabin where the flight attendant was currently hiding.“She’s doing her job, you psycho,” Barty jeers and returns to his book. His hard-on goes down after a series of calming breaths.  Mind over matter,  Barty muses as he thumbs through the book. Regulus wiggles in his seat and finds a comfortable nook to collapse in. His head is resting on Barty’s shoulder. Barty wants to shake him off, but the reassuring warmth emanating from his skin and the tickle of his black locks on Barty’s neck is too good to pass on. He suffers through the discomfort. His thighs twitch as he slides down the seat, posturing his body to create the comfiest pillow possible out of his stiff shoulder. Regulus hums contently and nods off seconds later. Barty peaks at James curiously, expects a death stare and a snarky comment, but James is engrossed in a conversation with Evan, swiping on his phone like a man possessed. Evan snickers and whispers something right into his ear. They both collapse in a fit of giggles. Barty elects to ignore them and make a valiant attempt at digesting the words he sees on the pages. He fails miserably, his mind in high alert and centred on every breath Regulus lets out and every slight twitch of his sleeping body.They spend the better part of their flight like that, snuggled against each other. Barty savours the moment. They’re in the final approach when Reg stirs and jerks away, darting his eyes around the cabin, disoriented. James is searching for their luggage in the overhead lockers. He strokes Regulus’ cheek affectionately. Regulus murmurs into his palm and presses his face into James’ stomach, wraps his long arms around his waist. “Did you sleep well?” James chuckles and cradles Regulus’s head, stroking him leisurely behind the ear. Regulus mumbles his response into the patch of skin above his navel. Barty presses his lips into a thin line and pretends not to pay attention, his eyes glued to the pages. As soon as the hatch door opens and the holidayers spill onto the concrete airport and into the scorching sun, Barty loosens up and forgets about Regulus. At least till they’re on the bus to the hotel and Regulus lumps himself into the seat in front of Barty, with James glued to his side, his wandering hands slipping under Regulus’ shirt. Barty soaks up the views. He was lucky enough to get a window seat. He drags his eyes across the shoreline. The water is ridiculously blue, the waves high, and the air smells like a promise of days to come. He tries to drone out Regulus’ snickers and James’ impassioned commentary, but they spill mercilessly over the seat and into Barty’s waiting ears. “I fucking hate them sometimes,” Evan rubs his forehead and exhales loudly. He speaks in a hushed tone, which is not necessary, Barty thinks. Both Regulus and James are too occupied with each other to eavesdrop on their mundane conversion. “Fuckers can’t behave in public.” “You’d think they’d stop by now,” Barty grimaces. “It’s been over a year of this shit.” When they get to the hotel and drag their suitcases to the lobby, Barty is more than ready for some alone time, and by alone, he means no love birds around. Evan he can handle. Regulus and James stay in the room for a quick fuck to relieve the tension after the arduous journey and the blueball incident. Barty and Evan make their way down to the hotel pool. Evan grabs them a pair of towels from the reception and gets into a spat with some kid who tries to one up them and swipe a pair of sun lounges right from under their noses. They get to plop down eventually, stretched out in the sun. Barty takes a deep breath, his lungs flooding with a grating smell of chlorine and burnt burgers coming from the hotel bar.  Perfect. Could not have planned it any better. Evan is at his side, humming contently, and Barty’s holding a full martini glass in his hand, swirling it around. He sips from it as he adjusts his sunglasses. He cracks his spine loudly and cackles at the juicy string of expletives that pour out of Evan. “Can you not do that, for fuck’s sake?” Evan spits out and sticks his AirPods in aggressively. “It freaks me out.” “Sorry, darling.” This is exactly what he’s been waiting for, Barty thinks to himself. He just has to stay on his game and not slobber over Regulus when he gets to watch him strutting around in swimwear, bathing in the sunlight, or licking ice cream from his, and probably James’, fingers. It’s going to be tricky, but not unfeasible. Evan’s presence sweetens the deal. It’s them against the world.  ⦽⦽⦽⦽ They spend most of the time mooching around the hotel and the neighbourhood, checking out the nearest beach first chance they get. The food at the morning buffet is exquisite. Barty stuffs his face until he can no longer move. They always sit together at breakfast, chattering and sampling the dishes. Barty admits that when Regulus and James are not sucking on each other’s necks, they’re actually decent company. On the third day Regulus gets antsy and makes them all take a trip across the island and up a mountain trail. They get back to the hotel sweaty and spent, craving bed more than any of the pleasures the island has to offer. To Barty’s discontent, James has enough energy to make Regulus come before they fall asleep in the adjacent room inside their luxurious suite. Together with Evan, they get to listen to Regulus’ swallowed whines for a good ten minutes before he arrives at the long awaited completion and blessed silence surrounds them once more. Barty almost suffocates himself with the pillow, trying his damn hardest to muffle the sounds. He has to roll over onto his stomach to conceal his hardening dick from Evan’s wandering gaze. “Get up,” Barty hears feet shuffling to his right and then Evan’s hand is pulling him off the bed sheets. They end up in the shower, cool water washing the sweat and sticky mud off their worn bodies, while Evan sinks to his knees and sucks him off, quick and dirty. Barty comes in the back of his throat with a stifled moan, his head banging painfully on the tiles. Evan wipes his mouth, climbs back on his feet and brushes the tip of his nose up the column of his throat. “Better?” he chuckles and licks some of the come into Barty’s parted mouth. “Much better,” Barty cups his cheeks and swipes his tongue out, licking on his bottom lip. They wrestle under the water stream, until Evan has him pressed against the wall, his warm breath tickling his nape. Barty gets fucked, torturously slowly, meticulously, as if Evan’s trying to take him apart with his cock, and with his broken moans and obscene words. They wash the come off their bodies and slip out of the shower. The apartment is dead silent when they slip under the covers. They elect to ignore Barty’s king and end up in the twin bed, their limbs tangled comfortably. The weather outside is stiflingly hot, but with the aircon buzzing quietly in the corner, their room is blissfully cool. “You got to rein it in,” Evan’s stroking his shoulder affectionately. His hair is still damp and he smells of citrus. Barty glues his eyes to the ceiling and remains silent, at first. “Whatever do you mean?” “Your schoolboy crush is showing,” Evan doesn’t budge and drills down. “James is not going to like it.” “What about Regulus,” Barty snaps, his brows furrowing. “I think I’m more worried about him.” “I have a feeling,” Evan hesitates and then says, “that our dear Regulus knows.” Barty twitches in Evan’s arms, feeling flustered. “Are you serious?” “I think he puts on a bit of a show for you, if I’m to be completely honest.” Evan broods, tapping a finger on his chin. “He definitely suspects.”Barty drags a hand over his face and whines defeatedly. “That means James knows,” he murmurs. “That little fucker tells him everything.” “I’m not so sure. I feel like if that was the case you’d be walking around with a broken nose by now.” “Nah, he can be a jealous bastard, but he’s not unreasonable,” Barty shrugs and turns towards Evan, burying his face in his smooth neck. “He would only have a go at me if I tried something. I’m not that stupid.” Evan chuckles and pulls him closer, his fingers skimming over his bare back, nails scratching the skin. “Well, I might be wrong. Regulus is pretty observant, even when he’s seemingly not paying attention.”They drift off after that, their faces inches away. Barty can feel his worn muscles thrumming under the covers, his taut body relaxing after the spectacular orgasm and the rest of the salacious events under the shower. Evan starts snoring, which is his cue to turn to his other side and attempt to get some sleep. He floats away into nothingness and dreams about Regulus and Evan going down on him at the same time, their tongues lapping at his dick and up his shaft, their teeth grazing the veiny underside. He wakes up with another raging hard on, which he gets rid of by humping Evan’s hip. Evan stirs awake and immediately bursts out laughing, but sticks his ass out obligingly and lets Barty rut against him till he comes in white streaks over the sheets and between Evan’s legs. “You’re so amped up these days,” Evan sniggers while wiping the come off the bed with his sweaty shirt from the hike. “What are you, sixteen again?” “I honestly have no idea.”  ⦽⦽⦽⦽ Minutes, hours, and days seem to pass at an accelerated pace. Before they know it, it’s ten days later and the dreaded flight back home is just around the corner. They went sightseeing, they hired a private boat to take them to see Los Gigantes which, in Barty’s humble opinion, might have been one of the most exhilarating experiences of his short life. They swam with a pod of dolphins and saw a massive sea turtle wobble past their boat. That whole afternoon was glorious. Evan stuck by his side, and Regulus and James were surprisingly amiable, too mesmerised by the views and the fauna circling their boat to pay heed to each other. The next morning, they decide they desperately need a ‘laze around and do nothing day, with no concrete plans whatsoever.’ They go their own ways and agree to bring beers and smokes to their favourite beach on the outskirts of the town. The beach is never crowded and ideal for late night ventures and drinking with a majestic sunset providing a perfect accompaniment. Evan brings a bottle of white in a cooler he bumped from the hotel bar, and Barty treats him to his freshly purchased tobacco. They smoke and drink in comfortable silence until James and Regulus turn up with a case of beers under James’ arm. Regulus decides to venture out for an evening swim and Evan jumps on the occasion. James slumps to the ground next to Barty, bumps his shoulder companionably, a wide grin stretched on his handsome face. “How was your day?” “Not bad,” Barty leans back and props himself up on his elbows, eyes searching for Evan and Regulus’ heads popping from between the waves. “What about you?” “It was great. I needed that for sure.” James cracks open a can. “We ate our fill at this lovely seafood restaurant and then went back to the hotel. Slept some more and then just faffed about.” “Lovely,” Barty responds, his train of thoughts inevitably leading him to to ponder the amount of fucking they must have done in that empty suite while Barty and Evan were out. They probably fucked on their beds. Disgusting. The only upside was that when Barty retires for the night he’ll get to stick his nose into the pillow and smell Regulus all over his bed sheets. “What did you guys do?” James wiggles his eyebrows and points his head towards the waves. Barty scoffs, “You know we are not together, right?” “You sure seem like a couple, and I mean that as a compliment. You’re cute together.” Barty grimaces and gives James a scornful look. “Cute is not the word I’d use,” he says. “We’re just friends, who somehow get on after a break up and enjoy a casual hook-up. It works. I wouldn’t want to change that.” “Fair,” James shrugs his shoulders and nods. “I get that. I admire it, even. I don’t think I’d be able to stay friends with Reg if he ever broke up with me.” “What if you broke up with him?” “Not likely,” James hums and takes a sip of his beer. Barty drags his eyes over his exposed shoulders and muscular back. He’s always been hot as hell, maybe not Barty’s type, but undeniably attractive. Barty gets it, really. “Never say never,” Barty mumbles into his plastic cup and averts his gaze. James turns to face him, a curious gleam in his eye. Barty tries to ignore the swooping feeling in his stomach. If Evan’s right and Regulus knows about his innocent crush… He’s fucked. James looks suspiciously calm, though. “Right now there’s nothing he could do or say that would make me break it off,” James states in a serious tone. “He could probably come up to me and say he’s murdered someone, and I’d ask him if he needs help disposing of the body.” “That’s so sweet of you,” Barty jeers. “But maybe don’t say shit like that, it’s like you’re tempting fate.” James laughs heartily and wraps his arms around his knees, looking longingly at Regulus’ slender frame emerging from the ocean and climbing up the strip of beach towards them, with Evan in tow. They are both dripping wet, salt crusting over their bodies. They prod and push at each other playfully, and Regulus has a gorgeous blush creeping up his neck and cheeks. The tip of his nose is burnt, the skin flaking off, but somehow, it makes him look even more attractive than usual. Evan gives Barty a warning look over Regulus’ shoulder. Only then he realises he’s been gawking at them shamelessly. Barty swallows, feels his tongue get thick in his mouth. He darts his eyes to the right and catches James’ inquisitive look. Barty swears and tries to hide his face in his cup and behind a freshly rolled cigarette. The four of them watch the sunset in silence, too stunned by the spectacle to utter even a single word. After that, the hum of the sea and the warm evening air stroking their skin lull them into a subdued conversation about everything and nothing. The night is peaceful, tranquil, only the muffled sounds of the nearby town intrude on their little corner of the world. Barty makes a trip to the nearest shop for another wine bottle, and when he’s back, the conversation has steered in a new direction. “It’s not that we mind, really, I’ve heard worse things. But I thought I’d mention it, in case you’d feel uncomfortable.” Barty feels hair stand on the back of his neck. “What are you talking about?” They are veering into dangerous waters and Barty’s not pleased. “I’m letting our dear Regulus know he’s being a little too vocal at times. I bet James is a talented man, but you could try to bite your tongue sometimes, Reggie. Especially when you know there are people next door.” Regulus burns red and sticks his head under James' arm. James coos at him soothingly but there’s an evident smirk on his lips. “I will try to keep it down,” Regulus promises reluctantly, peaking at them through his luscious eyelashes. He catches Barty’s stare and reciprocates with equal intensity, a pointed expression on his pretty face. Barty can feel his cheeks heating up as well. He pulls on the collar of his shirt, his skin prickling with foreboding. “I’ll take part of the blame for that one,” James raised his hand. “Don’t get too cocky, I’m not going to hear the end of it,” Regulus gibes and wiggles in James’ arms, slotting his ass deeper between his parted legs. Barty sips on his drinks and rakes his eyes over Regulus’ long legs, bare and still soaking wet, sand forming a thick layer on his skin and crusting off as Regulus rubs his calves against James’ outstretched leg. Barty grinds his teeth on the edge of his cup, watches as Reg’s toes curl in the sand, the sole of his feet dragging over the coarse grains. “Anyway, I do apologise,” James nods at them, his fingers carding though Regulus thick curls absentmindedly. “Like Evan said,” Barty decides it’s high time he joins in on the conversation and acts as casual as possible. “Not the worst thing I’ve heard, not the worst I’ve done.” Evan barks out a short laugh, face twisting in a mocking grimace. “Please, enlighten us.” Barty stretched out on his towel and stroked his chin, racking his brain. “There was one time I went away with a bunch of friends, and I had to listen to two of them act out a whole roleplaying scene through the thinnest wall possible. It was so bad, I could barely contain my laughter. I’m sure they had a lovely time, but I suffered that night.” Evan sent him a questioning look. “Who was it?” “You don’t know them,” Barty waves a hand at him dismissively.“You think that’s bad,” Evan swirls the cup in his hand and dabs his tongue in the liquid, savouring. The wine was actually not terrible. “I went to this conference last year, with my boss and his mistress.” “Your boss took his mistress to a work conference?” James questions, incredulous expression on his sun kissed face.“Aye, he did. I think he and his wife were already in the midst of a nasty divorce battle, but still... Weird guy. Anyway, we ended up in adjacent rooms, and god almighty, when I tell you I couldn’t sleep three nights in a row it wouldn’t be an exaggeration.”James shakes his head. “What a prick. I’m hoping you told him, right? Or at least went to HR?” Evan smirks under his nose and glances at Barty. Barty knows this story, he waits with bated breath for the rest of it.“I did tell him, and his lover. We were out on the last day, hitting up bars and just kicking about London. It was great, they’re actually lovely people, I had a blast. We had a couple of drinks, and I felt brave enough to insinuate I was more than aware of their nighttime activities. They were surprisingly cool about it.”“And? I feel like there’s more to this story,” Regulus chimes in. “We got talking,” Evan continues with a lecherous smile. “And they asked me if I wanted to join them that night.” James lets out a joyous laugh and Regulus' eyes spark with interest. “Did you?” “Yes, I did. Let’s just say it was a fun night. The girl had the right to be this ridiculously loud, the guy’s tongue was from another planet.” “Your boss’ tongue, you mean?” Barty scoffs. “Yes. He wasn’t my boss for long after that. I started the school business a couple of months later. But we’re still in touch.” James whistles and raises his bottle. “Not bad, Evan, not bad.” “Barty,” Regulus drawls with a wicked smile on his face. “Have you ever had a threesome?” “Nope,” Barty rasps out, desperately trying to avoid Regulus’ gaze. “You’d enjoy it, for sure,” Evan winks at him. “Next time the guy calls, I can ask him if they’re not looking for a fourth.” James grins and hides his face in Regulus’ curls, and Barty swallows audibly. “Please, don’t,” he says levelly, doing a decent job at disguising the tremble in his voice.“What about you two?” Evan points his chin at the couple. Regulus purses his lips but remains silent. James spills immediately. “ I have had the pleasure, more than once.” “Do tell,” Evan spurs him on and Barty’s ears perk up. “In my last relationship, we’ve done it with some friends and a couple of random hookups. It was great.” ‘With friends? Isn’t that risky?” Evan probes further while casting a funny look at Regulus. Barty risks a quick glance himself. Regulus' stone expression indicates he’s not enjoying the current topic of conversation, but he doesn’t intercede. James’ nimble fingers stroke his neck and the line of his jaw as he continues. “Yeah, it was risky. We ended up cutting the ties with one of them, but it wasn’t really due to the sex. We had other differences.” “That previous partner you did all that with, was that Lily?”James nods. Regulus twitches in James’ arms and scrunches his nose. “Sorry, baby,” James noses his cheek and places a chaste kiss on his temple. “It’s fine, we’re just talking. You’re allowed to talk about your exes.” Regulus spits out, but his cold eyes seem to be telling a different story. “So, it would seem we’ve all done some stuff,” Evan seamlessly shifts the topic of conversation and Regulus visibly relaxes. “What’s something you’ve not done but want to do?”“You’re just full of delightful questions today,” Barty sneers and sparks another fag. “I guess a threesome would be nice. I tend to just go with the flow. There’s not much I’d say no to.” James presses his lips together, his jaw twitching. He’s obviously trying to hold in a smirk, and Barty doesn’t know what to think of that. Regulus doesn’t lift his head, but there’s something akin to glee flashing in his grey eyes. Barty’s utterly confused by this point. “Yeah, you’re a depraved motherfucker, that’s about right,” Evan muses and earns himself a slap on the back of his head. “I always wanted to do it with two girls at once. And I’m curious to know how it feels to get dominated by a woman.” “It’s delightful,” James declares joyously. Regulus' eyes flash dangerously and he elbows him in the ribs. James lets out a pained moan. “Ah, sorry, baby.” “You’re so whipped,” Evan murmurs under his breath but doesn’t press for details. “What about you, Reggie? What deep and dark fantasies do you entertain?” There’s a crack of electricity in the air, Barty swears it. The atmosphere shifts, James gets serious and Regulus straightens up, lifts his chin and turns to look at James expectantly. Barty has no idea what awaits them around the metaphorical corner. It most assuredly is not the confession that spills not from Regulus’ but James’ lips. “Regulus has a little fantasy he shared with me recently,” James starts, hand sneaking up to Reg’s waist and squeezing reassuringly. “He’s never had a threesome. But that’s not really what he’s looking for either.” Barty and Evan exchange bewildered looks. “Mate,” Evan butts in, his brows furrowed. “He is sitting right there. Can’t you speak, Reggie?” Regulus darts his gaze towards Evan but his lips remain sealed. He twists his neck and hides his face in the dip of James’ throat. James hums approvingly and strokes his ruffled hair.“That’s right darling,” he breathes out, almost whispers into Regulus’ ear. Barty can see a visible tremor run through Reg’s body. He rubs his feet together, his toes digging into the sand. Barty swallows audibly. “Reggie asked me to share this one. He doesn’t want to speak. He wants to sit here, quietly, and just... enjoy himself.” “Okay,” Evan looks intrigued now. Barty is lapping up every word that falls from James’ mouth. “We’re very open about what floats our boat, so to speak. The things that Regulus hides in this pretty head of his. As soon as we felt comfortable around each other, he shared this little fantasy with me. I had to mull it over, I admit, but ultimately, I’m on board.” “Fucking hell, you’re keeping us on the edge of our seats. Just come out and say it,” Barty spurs him on. If he doesn’t find out what Regulus wants he’s going to combust. James takes a deep breath. “There’s one particular need I can’t satisfy, or rather, I need some help in order to fully satisfy it.” Evan’s jaw drops, but Barty’s brain is hazy, he’s not caught on yet. “Reggie would like to get fucked by other people, under my supervision,” James finally says and breathes out, his jaw clenching. The hand that rests on Regulus’ waist squeezes hard, nails biting into the skin. Regulus squirms and lets out a startled gasp into James’ neck. Barty gapes at them, saliva pooling in his mouth. Evan lets out a nervous giggle and swallows audibly, rubs the bridge of his nose before he even attempts to speak. “That’s interesting. Are you, ah, actively trying to look for someone to join you?” “Yes,” James minces his words, and Barty has had enough. He has to hear it, James has to spell it out for him before he goes insane. “And how is that going for you?” Evan prods.“No idea,” James raises his eyebrows at him, and then at Barty. “You tell me.” “You’re serious?” Evan is sitting up straight now, his plastic cup abandoned, wine dripping out and soaking into the sand. “Are you asking for what I think you’re asking? Regulus?”James clicks his tongue and shakes his head. “Don’t address him directly.” Barty feels lightheaded. The world around him tips to the side, his hands get clammy and his mouth dry as the sand they’re sitting on. His dick must be half hard by now, straining against his swim trunks. He has to lean forward and surreptitiously place his palms in his lap to disguise it. Evan’s not doing any better judging by his tense shoulders. “Is that part of the play?” “Yes,” James caresses Reg’s arm, all the way down to his elbow, with such delectable fondness and tenderness. As if he hasn’t just divulged the details of how his boyfriend wants to get fucked while he watches and directs the scene. Barty has to actively tell himself to take in another breath, otherwise he’d suffocate. For a second, James looks sheepish. He glances down at Regulus, who lifts his chin and noses his neck, murmurs something, too quietly for Barty to catch. James’ eyes glimmer in the night lights. His expression shifts and when he turns to them again, he’s determined.Evan is the one to break the silent spell.“You want us to join you? I’m sorry if I’m being Mister Obvious here, but I want to hear it loud and clear.” “Yes,” James nods, his grip on Regulus’ arm tightening. Evan and Barty exchange a fleeting glance. “Wouldn’t that… be risky? We’re friends, all of us here. You just said that doing it with friends is not always the best idea.” “Reg and I discussed it. We think out of all the people you two are the best candidates. I believe we can handle it.”James gestures towards Reg, who’s still cozied up under his arm, his eyes boring into James in reverence. A spike of jealousy runs through Barty, but it’s short-lived, transient. He’s made his peace with the fact that Regulus is unattainable. Now, fate has decided to grant him a chance to learn what he’ll feel like under his wandering hands, how he’ll squirm and writhe, how he’ll moan his name when Barty makes him come, same as he does for James. Maybe not the same, but it’s close enough. Beggars can’t be choosers. Barty gears himself up to speak but he’s only able to utter an incoherent grunt. “I’m game,” Evan beats him to the punch. Barty exhales loudly, relief washing over him. They will do this together. Them against the world, in everything, including shagging their friends, apparently. “Splendid,” James beams at them. He’s the picture of innocence, utterly inappropriate considering the circumstances. “What about you, Barty?” “I think you know the answer to that question,” he manages to rasp out, words struggling to crawl out of his throat. He coughs into his arm, eyes skipping over James’s delighted grin and down towards Regulus. Look at me , Barty implores silently. He wants Regulus to acknowledge him, acknowledge what he’s just asked them to do. Regulus doesn’t budge. He only has eyes for James. Barty grinds his teeth. He can handle this, he’s a big boy. He can fuck one of his best friends while taking direct orders from his boyfriend, and then walk away unbothered and unchanged. Sure, he can. “Great,” James puffs his chest out proudly. Barty almost rolls his eyes. It was downright pathetic at times, how far James was willing to go for Regulus. He briefly wonders if this is all Regulus’ idea and James is a rather unwilling accomplice. But no, that can’t be it. James is eager and animated, aroused even. He steps into the role like he was born for it. “We have to set some ground rules first. Like I said, this is a fantasy that we’re trying to tick off the list. This doesn’t carry over to our everyday life. And you’re right, Evan, that kind of shit can ruin friendships, so if at any point you feel like you want to tap out, you say it and you leave. Understood?” Evan and Barty nod and lean towards James, soaking up every word. Barty almost plants face first into the sand, but catches himself at the last second.“I have to hear you say it,” James implores. “Yes,” they both exclaim in chorus. “Great. Now, safe words. We’ve been using them for a while, and they’ve done a decent job. It’s simple - green is for enthusiastic consent, yellow signifies that we might be edging towards a potential hard limit, but we can continue. Red means you cut it out immediately. Is that clear?” “Couldn’t have been clearer,” Evan raises his thumbs and Barty hums in approval. “Next, this is Reggie’s play. It might seem like he’s not the one in control, and for the purpose of the scene, he’s not. We’ve discussed this and he trusts me. He can always back out if he feels like it. I have the intimate knowledge of what will fly and what won’t. You can ask for anything your heart may desire, and I can agree or knock it back. You don’t have to limit yourself, but remember that your wish might be declined.” Barty’s mind is swimming. James’ words reach him and pierce through his thick skull, but he feels like he’s sitting behind a wall, or a film of some sorts, that’s muffling the sound and forcing Barty to work excessively hard to digest the instructions. He can ask for anything, and his wish might be granted. He’s fearful of what dark fantasies his mind might concoct. “Any hard limits we should not even mention?” Evan asks. He seems unruffled. Decidedly more relaxed than Barty, his laid-back attitude paying off even in the most unusual of circumstances. “Nope, you go for it, I will tell you if it's green or red. If Regulus doesn’t agree with my directions, he can use the safeword.” “You’ve really put a lot of thought into it,” Evan is visibly impressed, dazzled even, by this whole idea. The initial shock dissipates and he’s verging on giddy when he tilts his head and bores his eyes into Regulus. “And what about the rule of not being able to address his highness directly? I feel like we might need a tad more here. Don’t want to cross any of your precious boundaries.” James stokes Reg’s bony shoulder with his thumb as he explains. “Right, you can’t. You can interact with him while you’re engaging in… sex. But don’t ask him if you can do this or that, ask me. You can engage with him, and with each other, that's a given. But Regulus should remain the focus of the scene, at all times.” “You’re really getting off on this, don’t you?” Barty scoffs at Regulus. He doesn’t mean to sound curt, and James jumps down his throat immediately. “Don’t,” he warns, brows furrowing, “address him directly. You can ask me the same question. And yes, he is getting off on that. You’re not any different, I reckon.” He points his head at Barty’s crotch and smirks. Barty turns red as a beet and hides his face in his shoulder, and Evan snorts into his freshly filled cup. “Once again,” James puts them in their place with a stern face. “If you don’t feel comfortable with these rules, tap out now. If at any point you start feeling uncomfortable, you do that as well. Don’t disappoint me, and especially, don’t disappoint Regulus.” Regulus quivers in James’ strong embrace and Barty twitches violently when another shiver runs down the length of his spine and straight to his half-hard dick. “I have one more question,” Evan scratches his nose and smiles politely at James, as if they’re discussing the weather. “I get that you’re the authority, and we should ask you for your permission, so I’m asking. We can’t direct our questions at Regulus, but can we… address him in the throes of passion?” Evan looks smug when he adds, “Can I praise him or tell him what a good boy he is? Can I throw in some dirty talk, maybe a couple of degrading words here and there?”“That’s allowed,” James murmurs and bites his lip, hard. “Reggie enjoys that, immensely.”  “Oh, I know he does!” Evan snorts and downs the rest of his wine. “We had a distinct pleasure of listening to your esteemed performance in the last week, not once, and not twice. I want to say…” “Many times,” Barty interrupts. “That’s some vocabulary you have, James.” “Thanks, I guess?” James grins at them, showing off his white teeth.“Right, I think we should… head to the hotel, then?” Evan shakes the sand off his trunks and starts packing their swimming gear, half finished bottle of wine tucked under his arm. “If we don’t go now I think poor Barty will get an aneurysm.” Barty growls at him and jumps to his feet, his backpack strategically placed on his crotch. James places another soft kiss on Reg’s ruffled curls and pulls him up gingerly. Regulus is like putty in his hands. Barty’s in a constant state of haze on their way back. Regulus and James walk in front of them, arms wrapped around each other like tendrils.Barty gapes, rakes his eyes over their figures bathed in streetlamp light. He can see a sliver of skin just above Regulus’ trunks, coarse sand still sticking to his pale skin and flaking off as James rubs his thumb over his hip. “Barty, you’re with me?” Evan nudges him in the shoulder as they walk back to the hotel, a jump in their step that Barty thinks must be conspicuous enough that all the passersby know they’re going back to the hotel for a foursome. “Yeah, what’s up?”“Are you sure you want to do this?” “Are you insane? Of course I do,” he croaks and clears his throat. Too eager. “I know you want to fuck him, I’m not an idiot,” Evan concurs with a slight irritation in his voice. “I am just questioning whether you’d be able to function after the scene ends. Did you listen to what James said? This does not extend outside of the bedroom, and outside of this day even. Next morning we wake up and it’s over. It’s very likely they will never make the same offer again.” “I know,” Barty spits out through clamped teeth. “And I am fine with it. Are you?” “I know I am,” Evan huffs and rolls his eyes. “I’m trying to take care of you, you numpty.” “I appreciate that, really. I’ll be fine.” “Good,” Evan concedes and brightens up. “Don’t come to me crying if it doesn’t end well for you. I mean, do come to me crying if you feel like it. I’m still your friend. But I’ll be able to say  I told you so !” Barty doesn’t respond and Evan graciously doesn’t mock him further. “Anyway,” they reach the hotel and climb up the staircase to their suite. The elevator was packed and James and Reg took up all the available space. “I did not expect the night to go like this. Did you?” “No,” Barty fishes out his key card and slides it through the slit in the door. They slip into the apartment and find James and Regulus already there, sprawled on Barty’s bed. “Give us ten minutes,” James points his head towards their room and takes Reg by the hand. “We’re just going to have a little chat and I’ll invite you when we’re ready. I suggest you shower, we’ll do the same.” “Right,” Barty rubs his clammy palms together. “Evan?” “Sure,” Even throws a fresh towel at Barty’s head and careens towards the bathroom. Barty follows. It is the speediest shower Barty has ever taken, and Evan is not far behind. He’s thorough but not indulgent. His dick won’t go down, which Evan finds hysterical for some reason.“Want me to get you off before we go in?” he jeers and licks his lips in a mocking gesture. “Fuck off,” Barty grumbles as he pulls on a fresh shirt and boxers. They sit on the bed, criss-cross, both tapping their hands on their knees in anticipation. A thought flashes through Barty’s mind, a sudden doubt, a crippling fear that activates when you know you’ve made a mistake but there’s no going back now. Evan brushes his knee with his fingers and squeezes reassuringly. “You can back out.”“I can’t,” Barty takes a calming breath, counting to three. “I have to have him. I have to know.” “Healthy,” murmurs Evan and he goes back to watching the door.“How are you always so self-possessed?” Barty snarls, but before he has a chance to hear the answer, James shoots through the door. His hair is dripping wet and he’s got a fresh set of clothes on. Evan shamelessly checks him out.“Can I just ask, what do you get out of it? I got the impression Reg is the driving force behind this whole idea?” “Oh, don’t worry, I’ll get my fill,” James returns his gaze head on. They follow James into the room. Barty’s heart is threatening to beat out of his chest. The moment they step inside, all his blood drains south. Regulus is kneeling on the floor, knees splayed open and his naked ass brushing the carpet. He’s clasped his fingers behind his back and his back is arched, chin lifted. He risks a quick glance in their direction and Barty can almost hear his pulse quicken, his chest now rising in an uneven rhythm. Barty latches his eyes to his hard, pink, nipples and he wants to crawl on his knees and swirl his tongue over the pink glands. He wants to suck hard and bite, test the boundaries of what Regulus can take. He knows he has to wait his turn. They halt at the entrance, both him and Evan looking at James expectantly. “How are we, Reggie?” James hums and saunters closer, cups his cheeks in his palm and strokes his bottom lip tenderly with the tip of his thumb. Regulus parts his lips, lets him slide the thumb into his mouth. He suckles on it, moans quietly. Barty’s eyes dart to the space between his spread knees, where his cock twitches to life and rubs on James’ leg. Barty swallows, wipes his forehead with the back of his hand. He is rock hard now, blood thrumming in his veins. To his right, Evan sucks in a loud breath and jerks closer. “Green,” Regulus mumbles around James’ thumb, his pink tongue darting out and swiping over his neatly trimmed nails. James retreats and Regulus whines quietly at the loss, rubs off the drool that trickles down his chin on his shoulder. He straightens out, his unseeing eyes bouncing back to James’ face. “Good,” James purrs out his praise, and Regulus melts, his knees sliding further apart. “It’s your turn now. What do you want to do?” He swirls around and his eyes land on Barty and Evan, who are both hyperventilating on the other side of the room. Evan gives him a heads start and waits patiently, but Barty’s words get lodged in his throat. Evan comes to his rescue, as is his nature. “Can you show him off?” Barty's eyes go wide but Evan doesn’t falter. He drawls on, his pupils going dark. “Get him on the bed and spread his legs. I want to see what he’s got to offer.” Barty’s cheeks are flaming red, and he is not the only one. Regulus lets out a choked moan and grinds on the carpet, his dick chafing on the course fibres. James and Evan exchange a burning look, a thread of understanding forming between them. There’s appreciation and mutual respect in there, and Barty seethes, jealousy curling around his heart. There’s not enough time for him to stew in that feeling; he’s promptly distracted by James dragging Regulus up to his feet by sliding his fingers into his hair and pulling gently. “That’s right,” James encourages and pulls him closer. Reg’s now standing on his two feet, thighs visibly trembling, back still arched and hands clasped behind his back. James places a wet kiss alongside his jaw, pinches the skin with his teeth. “Reggie, I’m going to sit down and you’re going to come to me when I call,” James commands, takes a step back and edges towards the bed. Regulus stays put. “Can I touch him?” Evan blurts out, while his fingers are working the top button of his shirt. “Before?” “Yes,” James throws himself on the pillows, posture relaxed. He spread his legs slightly, in preparation to receive Regulus’ pliant body. Barty watches with rapt fascination as Evan strolls towards the centre of the room and stands in front of Regulus, his breath ghosting over his face. His shirt is unbuttoned now, and he shakes it off carelessly. He reaches out and strokes Reg’s collarbone, his fingers dipping into the skin. He gradually edges down, takes in a sharp breath when the tip of his fingers catches on his stomach and brushes through the thick thatch of black hair trailing towards Reg’s crotch. Regulus mewls quietly and shivers, the muscles of his thighs straining as he tries to hold still.Barty floats towards them, coming to a halt when he’s close enough to witness Evan wrap his fingers around Regulus’ half-hard cock. Everyone in the room utters a quiet gasp when Regulus goes rigid under the touch, thrust his hips forward and parts his lips, invitingly. Evan swallows and rasps out, “Can I kiss him?” “Blanket permission to kiss him,” James’ voice seems distant, steady and strong amongst their hitched breathing and pounding hearts. Evan lunges forward and captures Reg’s mouth in a searing kiss, nips on the bottom lip and pushes his tongue in. Regulus melts under his touch, his hips setting on a steady rhythm. Evan gives back, drags his thumb over the head and strokes harder, earning himself a broken moan, uttered right into his open mouth. “Fuck’s sake,” Barty’s rubs his eyes, still not entirely sure he’s not hallucinating. “That’s plenty,” James beckons at them and tilts his head to the side. “You don’t want to make him come too soon. He can bounce back, but enough is enough. He’s not earned it.” Evan drags the flat of his tongue over Regulus’ bottom lip and lets go of his cock. Regulus chases after him, stumbles forward. Evan gently nudges him towards the bed. “On you go, hop on.” Regulus stares at him blankly, mouth still parted and then… He drops to his knees and starts crawling on all fours towards the bed, his ass on full display. Barty’s fingers itch to reach out and caress his pale skin, the bend of his back and the dip between his cheeks. Regulus climbs on the bed and drags his body over the bed sheets, rubs his straining cock on the duvet, leaving a glistening trail of precum behind. A flicker of impatience runs through James’ face. He bites his nails in Reg’s jaw and drags him closer, lifting him off the sheets. He flips him around and guides him to lay between his spread legs, his back flush to his chest. “You’re so impatient,” James drags his lips over his earlobe and grazes the skin under his ear. Regulus shudders in response. “So eager to get off. How many times do you want to come tonight?” Regulus bares his neck. “You decide.”“Let’s see what they come up with then,” James quips and glances at Evan, and then at Barty, a glint of challenge in his eyes. “Blanket permission to come.” Evan’s face stretches in a wide grin. He kneels on on the bed, the springs creaking under their combined weight. “Come now, Reggie. I want to see it. Spread your legs for me,” he taunts. James’ hands slide under the bend of Regulus’ clenched knees. “Come on, baby, show them,” he puts pressure on the soft skin, nails biting into the flesh. He spreads Regulus’ legs wide, relishes in the way his pliant body slumps against his chest.Barty clasps a hand over his mouth to muffle a loud groan; Evan is not as guarded as him and lets out a breathless fuck, his eyes raking over Regulus’ hard cock bouncing on his stomach, the white skin peppered with fine hair, and the pink, puckered hole. “So hot,” Evan chokes out. “I can’t wait to come inside you. James, can you open him up for me?” James already has a bottle of lube in his hands. He squirts an obscenely large amount into his palm. “They want to see, so let’s show them,” James nips at Regulus’ jaw, distracting him, while his hand slides between his legs and cusps his balls, then slides lower and prods at the entrance. Regulus writhes in his grip, arches his back and canters his hips, impaling himself on the index finger. James pushes inside, goes knuckles deep in one swift motion. Barty gasps, his own ass clenching down as if he’s the one being fingered. Evan falls forward and crawls on all fours, his face level with James’. They look at each other, wicked smiles dancing on their lips, a silent conversation taking place. Barty feels cold sweat gathering in the small of his back, but he doesn’t know how to make himself act, how to engage and seamlessly fit into the scene. “Can I suck him off?” Evan whispers, his lips almost brushing over James' jaw. He’s hovering over Regulus, who’s whimpering softly, now with two fingers up his ass slowly working him open. “Yes,” James nods and yanks his fingers out, wipes the lube in Regulus’ soft curls. Evan dips his head and takes him in, tongue lapping on the head and alongside the shaft. He puffs his cheeks and sucks hard and Barty feels a spark of pleasure shoot through him at the memory of that same skilled tongue dragging over his dick merely days ago. Regulus sings under Evan, sweet, broken moans spilling out of his wet lips. His palms clasp on James’ thick thighs, nails digging in painfully. James hisses but doesn’t push him off. “Evan,” James is breathing fast now. Barty’s convinced that Reg’s riding his hard cock right now, must be grinding back on it. He can imagine the clothed head sliding over the cleft of his ass. “Do what you want to him. I’ll tell you if you should stop.” Evan is ravenous. He doesn’t stop at the dick in his mouth, he licks on the balls and nips the skin with his teeth, Reg jerking under him and crying out in elation. He drags his tongue over the taint and dips it into his hole. James hand is now stroking Regulus to the same rhythm that Evan’s tongue is fucking into him. It’s rushed and hard. They’re not giving Regulus a chance to protest or warn them. Regulus goes rigid, thighs shaking around Evan’s head, and comes all over his flat belly and James’ fingers. “Fuck, you taste good.” Evan emerges from between his legs, wipes his lips with the back of his hand, eyes. He meets James stare. “Blanket permission to kiss, you say?” he taunts and then he dips down again, laps up Regulus’ come and then captures James’ lips in a searing kiss. Barty can see the streaks of come trickling down James' jaw. They’re both panting hard.  You’d think they just came, and not Regulus, who’s still struggling to catch his breath crushed under Evan’s heaving chest. ‘Fucking hell,” James lets out a started laugh, “You’re lucky I liked it. I didn’t give you permission to kiss me.” “Sorry,” Evan sits back on his haunches and has the decency to look contrite. “Won’t happen again.”“Apology accepted,” James hums and pats Regulus’ on the shoulder. “Get up.” Evan jumps back, letting Regulus crawl forward on the bed, ass up. James slaps him playfully and turns his attention towards Barty. “You’re being awfully quiet,” he teases, raising an eyebrow at him. “What do you want?” “I think Barty might need some directions,” Evan chimes in innocently and winks at him. “I…” Barty stammers and rakes a hand through his hair anxiously. “Maybe?” “Stand here,” James points to the foot of the bed, right where Regulus’ was just crawling towards, his ass up in the air and thighs splayed wide on the crumpled sheets. “Reggie, darling. Can you do me a favour and suck Barty off? But don’t you dare put that ass down. We’re going to play with it while he comes down your throat. Is that ok?” Regulus whines into the duvet. “Green.” Barty finds himself standing at the foot of the bed, his legs trembling, with Regulus deft fingers dipping under the waistband of his shorts. Evan’s at his side. He helps get his cock out, while trailing a kiss down Barty’s neck. “Come on, relax a bit. Look who’s opening their pretty mouth for you?” he says while placing the tip of his cock on Regulus’ bottom lip. Precum leaks down his chin and dribbles onto the sheets.Regulus murmurs contently and sticks his tongue out, licks the rest of the precum off the tip, then cleans his stained lips by pressing them to the inside of Barty’s thigh. Barty lets out a string of curses, pinches himself hard at the base. “Can I fuck his face?” Barty is ready to make his wish. \n Can I fuck his impudent, absurdly beautiful face, and these plump lips, and slide over that pink tongue that’s now lapping on his head eagerly?  \n“Do your worst,” James nods and turns to Evan. “I think you should also fuck him, just not his face. Fuck his ass.” Barty bristles at the thought of Evan getting to put his dick in that tight ass first, but then Regulus takes him in whole, his lips stretching around his girth. The tip hits the back of his throat. Barty yanks Regulus by the hair, eliciting a pained moan, its vibrations running down his length and straight to the pit of his stomach. In the corner of his eye he sees Evan position himself behind Regulus, now naked, slotting his thick dick between Regulus’ thighs. He knows James is sitting to his left, watching like a hawk. Barty thrusts in and grabs Regulus beneath his chin, feeling out the shape of his cock through the fine skin. “How do you fit it all in?” he marvels and then punches in hard. Regulus gags, spits on himself. Barty flickers his eyes to James in a silent question. “He’s fine,” he assures. “We have a way to signal the safeword if he can’t speak.” Evan chooses that moment to pull his lube coated fingers from Regulus’ ass and slide his dick over his gaping hole. “You ready?” he pats Regulus’ on the back. The only answer they get is a silent whimper. Evan pushes in, and Barty does the same, skewering Regulus on both ends, trapped and helpless, but so deliciously responsive. Barty’s envious. More envious than he’s ever been of James, or anyone. The inside of Regulus’ mouth is soft and spongy. The scorching heat that envelopes him and swallows him whole with every thrust makes his insides churn. Teeth catch on the veiny underside, and Barty hisses, yanks Regulus by the hair. He mewls an apology and coughs around him, his throat spasming. Evan groans and spits out a couple of incoherent words, then grabs Regulus by the hips, drags him back, impaling him on his cock, turning him into a living fleshlight. Regulus lets them, his throat going slack, his thighs opening up further. Barty supposes that Regulus’ cock must be hard again. He’s dreaming about what he will do to it after he comes in the back of his throat. He knows he’d be the first to tumble over the edge. He grinds his hips and bites through his lip when he expels what feels like excessive amounts of come onto the waiting tongue. Barty yanks Regulus’ head back and before he’s done coming, he slides out from between his parted lips and paints his chin and flushed cheeks with white, glistening streaks. Evan watches with wide eyes as Barty smears the come all over freckles cheeks and chokes out a broken moan as he seats himself deep inside and fucks his come inside Regulus’ hole.It’s a bit of a blur, after that. Barty feels a levee break with that first orgasm. He mumbles out his next wish, and James abides. He flips Regulus' boneless body on his back and grabs him under the knee, spreading his legs wide. As he suspected, he is hard again. It looks painful, straining against his sticky stomach, the head swollen and dark red. Barty has to know what it feels like in his mouth. He laps on it, cleans him thoroughly. Regulus cries under him, cants his hips up in search of friction. Barty is not paying attention to what James and Evan are doing, his mind wrapped up in Regulus, his smell, his breathy moans, his clenched thighs. He pushes his finger inside his stretched hole, one and then another. Evan’s come serves better than lube. It squelches obscenely around his fingers.His dick fills out in minutes of just doing that, just sucking on every visible part of Regulus’ compliant body and fingering him at a brutal pace. When he’s ready he hovers over Regulus, takes a steadying breath. Looks him in the eye. Regulus is not there, it would seem. Some newly born creature, a lustful demon with eyes black as night and lips blood red, lures him in to take the bait. “Fuck me,” the demon pleads and lift its shaking fingers to his face, strokes his chin tenderly. Barty splits him open, fucks into the mess that Evan’s left inside. He punches in deep, grinds his hips down. Regulus squeals under him, presses his cheek into the pillow to muffle his beautiful screams. Barty admits he’s lost any semblance of control. He’s rutting into him, teeth at the base of his neck, string of moans escaping his lips with every drag of his dick over his raw insides. Regulus clenches around him and Barty comes for the second time, uses him to empty himself, like it’s all he’s there for. The thought that his come melds with Evan’s and fills him to the brim satisfies some dark, bone-deep need Barty didn’t realise he had. His thighs are shaking so badly he’s barely able to pull out and topple to the side. He’s still catching his breath when Evan leans over him and lets out an amused chuckle. “You really went to town,” he gives a quick glance at Regulus, who’s not moved and is now cupping his hole, creating a barrier with his fingers to stop the come from leaking out. “Come on, your turn is over. Get up.”With Evan’s help, Barty rolls off the bed and manages to stand up. A clink of a metal buckle and a ruffling of fabric is what makes him look up from Regulus’ trembling body and back to the foot of the bed. James throws his shirt to the side and kicks off his trousers. Barty gapes at his cock, mouth salivating. James is hung, and already hard. He strokes the head of his cock, breathing through his nose. He must have been watching them. What was he thinking, or feeling? “Jamie,” Reg’s toes curl on the sheet. He spreads his knees further, and then slowly withdraws his fingers, putting his puffy and abused hole on display. Come is leaking down the cleft of his ass and onto the white sheets, it’s sticking to the black hair and the pale insides of his thighs. “Perfect,” James grabs him by the ankles and hauls him closer. Barty watches entranced as he slots between Regulus waiting legs and fucks into him in one violent push. They can all hear the squelch. The come oozes out, dribbles onto James’ skin. James huffs in effort and grinds his hips down. They moan in tandem. He peppers Regulus’ slender neck with kisses, then his ears, then the sweaty skin under his jawline. “God,” he croaks and ruts against Regulus, who wriggles under him and fists the sheets. “You feel so good. So loose, fucking hell, it’s never felt like that.” Regulus comes with an almost surprised gasp, his heels digging into James’ back. Barty recalls the feeling of Regulus’ ass clenching around him, and he covets. He bores his eyes into James’ back as he convulses in Regulus’ arms, fills him up to the brim, pushing their come out with his own. Barty gets it now. He understands, finally, what James is getting out of the scene.  “Dirty fucker,” Evan gasps with admiration. Barty grits his teeth and grabs him by the elbow, pulls him towards the exit. “Hey, what the fuck,” Evan protests. “The show’s not over.” “Yes, it is,” James rolls over onto his back. Barty blushes when he sees his cock, covered in sticky come from the swollen tip to the base. “Hope you enjoyed yourself.” Evan barks out a laugh. “Fucking hell, yeah, I know I have!” Regulus has not attempted to move. He’s playing with the come, dragging his fingers over his stretched hole, dipping them in curiously. “I’ve got to take a shower,” Barty can feel the sweat drying on his skin. He slips his boxers on and hands Evan the other pair. “That’s fair,” James has his eyes closed. Barty jaw drops to the floor when Regulus smears the come he’s dug out of himself on James’ hip and giggles. Evan coughs lightly. “Right, time for us to go.” “Let’s hope breakfast is not going to be too awkward,” Regulus adds just as they’re about to slip out of the room. Evan cackles loudly and Barty rolls his eyes.",
	"45744394000": "Pandora awoke with a jolt.\nIt was the middle of the night, the dim light from the moon only illuminated a small part of the room. Her body was moist, soaked in sweat, and she felt the long blond curls sticking to her forehead and neck.\nIt had happened again. It hadn’t happened for so long that she was actually starting to worry, you never know she was healed magically from her condition!\n\"It happens to you because you’re special Panda, you’ve been chosen,\" said her mother, with a feeble voice and eyes full of tears, perhaps of joy, perhaps of sadness, Pandora had never understood.\nThe dream, or better to say nightmare, was always the same: she who got up from bed, struggling to drag her weight to the last door of the corridor where her older brother Rabastan slept.\nThe journey seemed longer and longer, and the corridor darker than ever. Pandora was afraid of the dark, she didn’t like the feeling of being wrapped in a dark blanket.\nShe felt sinking, as if that darkness had the same consistency as honey, saturated and sticky. She wrapped her small hand around the door handle and pushed slowly, peering through the small crack that had formed.\n«Rab? Are you awake?» she whispered.\nRabastan was the brother she trusted the most, he was good at braiding and he always played with her at dolls. He always knew what to do whenever Pandora had one of her episodes. Moreover, Rabastan did not have the thick eyebrows that Rodolphus had, which made him look like a grumpy bear.\n«Rabby?» Pandora called her brother again, shaking his arm.\nSomething was wrong. His brother was cold, turned to his left side. He didn’t seem to move, he almost looked... No. Pandora knew death all too well, she saw it right in its face the day her parents were killed. Rabastan was just sleeping.\nFrustrated, she used all the strength she had to turn her brother’s body. She heard a scream, was there a girl screaming? Why was she screaming? Who was with them? Besides her and her two older brothers no one else lived in that house.\nRabastan stood there, his skin bluish , mouth wide open and face twisted. In the meantime , her brother Rodolphus had woken up. He immediately ran to embrace her, holding her so tightly causing her to look away from that terrifying sight.\nIf she focused enough, she could still feel the fabric of her brother’s pyjamas rubbing against her face as he rocked her and whispered repeatedly in her ear that everything was fine.\nBut Pandora, although she was small, understood that it was, in fact, not well.\nHer parents were not well, her brother Rabastan was not well, the person who had screamed was not well.\nIt took her years to realise that that night the scream came from her.",
	"45744364000": "She had always loved reading.\n\nLoved learning and exploring as the words morphed into images in her mind like puzzle pieces clicking into place. Hermione’s entire existence was based on the verses and paragraphs that she consumed at an abnormally quick rate. Her above average reading level earned her praise from her teachers and parents but made her somewhat of an outcast in grade school as the kids her age didn’t understand her. She preferred the library while they favored braiding hair or playing games outside.\n\nShe didn’t consider her childhood to be lonely, even though her parents were quite busy running their dental practice and were scarcely home, she had never minded as she found comfort and companionship with the characters and authors between the spines and pages that her eyes danced across.\n\nHer love for books and knowledge increased exponentially when she received her letter from Hogwarts. Hermione decided that she would do her absolute best to fit in to her new world. Which of course in her mind meant that she needed to read everything she could get her hands on about magic so that she wouldn’t seem silly or lost. Not only was she curious and excited to embrace something wholly unknown to her, but she also felt a deep need to compensate for being muggle-born, a term that had slowly started to itch at her skin the more she saw it in her research.\n\nIt took some time but eventually she had made some friends. Two boys who relied on her love for books, intelligence and analytical skills. Most days she wasn’t sure how Harry and Ron had managed to make it to the end of the week alive... their proclivity for stumbling upon and getting into trouble and their complete disregard for their grades was truly astonishing.\n\nWhile Harry was strong, courageous and bold, he had the tendency to be denser than the cake served in her parent’s favorite muggle cafe. And Ron was, well, he was Ron. He tended to be the more emotionally reactive one of their trio. She didn’t blame or fault either of them for who they were just as they accepted her for her more reserved studious nature.\n\nOver the years she learned to brush off the dirty blood slurs fired her way from her peers, more specifically, a boy with the silkiest blonde hair she had ever seen. She accepted the sneers of other students when they called her ‘the golden girl’ or ‘the brightest witch of their age’ with a mild smile on her face as if she hadn’t just been verbally slapped for basically being called an ‘insufferable know it all’. It wasn’t what she set out to be but nonetheless it became required and expected of her.\n\nCompleting an eighth year at Hogwarts was not common, and by not common, she had read that it was practically unheard of.\n\nShe had missed so much learning while on the hunt for Horcruxes with Harry and Ron. Missed so much time being ordinary teenage witch and doing what every other student had done their senior years. She didn’t regret her friendship with the boys at all! But something was missing. Almost as if a chapter had been ripped out of the book that was her life.\n\nSo, for the first time, Hermione elected to take the unstudied and unexpected route. She was going to return to Hogwarts instead of accepting a position at the ministry like her friends and almost every other witch or wizard who had survived the previous year. If she really was to become ‘the brightest witch of their age’ she believed she needed to finish her education and maybe while she was there she would learn how to be her own person separate from Harry and Ron again.\n\nHaving the details already worked out with McGonagall, she made the announcement of her plan to attend an eighth year during a post-war interview with the Prophet in the middle of the summer. She was standing in her small room at Grimmauld place reading the published statement with a small smile on her face when a group of owls flocking to her window startled her enough to drop the paper.\n\nHermione couldn’t believe the words scrawled on the notes she had received from the birds. One after another stating that she wouldn’t be alone in her eighth year. She sat gingerly on the corner of her bed and read through them all again.\n\nLuna and Neville had decided to join her upon reading her interview claiming they both wanted a do-over and their time at Hogwarts didn’t feel complete. Ginny of course would be returning as it was her seventh year and she couldn’t be happier to hear that they would get more time together away from the boys and their mischief. A few Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws that she had studied regularly with in the library also jumped on the wagon to return upon hearing that there would be others.\n\nThe summer seemed to fly by after that in a mass of dreadfully hot days and random lunch dates with the boys.\n\nShe was just stepping on to the platform for the Hogwarts Express and began moving in the direction of her usual car when she saw them. Ginny ran into her from behind due to her quick stop after crossing through the passageway causing her to stumble forward a bit awkwardly.\n\n“Hermione what in the bloody he-” Ginny hissed.\n\nIt took one glance in the direction that held Hermione captive and then Ginny was quickly whispering the news her father had brought home from the ministry the night before in her ear.\n\nThey were to return as some sort of slap on the wrist punishment for their involvement with the Dark Lord and his cause... the Ministry had deemed Azkaban too harsh a punishment for their age. She nodded mutely and started slow careful steps towards the humming train. She agreed that Azkaban was too much, but she was now doubting her choice of taking an eighth year.\n\nShe had secluded herself in Harry’s unused Grimmauld place all summer, as he was busy rebuilding the house in Godric’s Hollow, trying to get back to normal… trying so desperately to figure out what she wanted instead of what was expected of her that she had completely forgot about the people who had chosen to fight for the other side. The people she hadn’t seen since they had all been standing in the rubble of their school surrounded by bodies of people they once knew.\n\nThey walked in pairs, floating across the platform as if they owned it, as if nothing had changed. A shaky breath escaped her as she felt Ginny’s fingers lace with hers. Hermione watched them through her lashes, readying herself for any one of the sharp comments that she’d grown used to over the years but they all passed by her silently. No one uttered a word or offered her anything other than a blank facial expression.\n\nPansy Parkinson led their group next to Blaise Zabini, Theodore Nott marched beside Marcus Flint, Astoria Greengrass was shouldering Gregory Goyle, and they were all followed by the boy who had vexed her entire existence since the moment she set eyes on him before the sorting ceremony. Draco Malfoy.\n\nShe remembered feeling the slight blush creep into her cheeks when she saw him first, it was like one of her book characters had come to life, making her feel euphoric. And then he happened to open his mouth.\n\nDraco affected her more than she cared to admit over their shared years at Hogwarts. From making her cry when he called her foul names to inspiring her to punch him straight in the nose one day. It felt good at the time, but it was something her brain had played on repeat when she was unable to sleep lying in bed late at night. But unfortunately, no matter how much he angered her there was always that small unexplainable budding warmth deep within her veins whenever she saw him.\n\n“Come on, let’s go find Neville and Luna.” Ginny urged with a gentle tug on her hand.\n\nHermione looked back watching the crowd of students and parents quickly step out of the way of the Slytherins. She nodded as she swiveled her head back towards Ginny and offered her a small smile.\n\nShe took one more peek over her shoulder catching a glimpse of the tall blonde ducking into a car towards the front. He turned his head at the last second and their eyes connected. Her blood warmed and she shivered before she forced herself to look away.\n\n“Let’s.” She agreed and started moving rather quickly toward their usual car.",

Before Peter could question this the door opened and Sirius walked in,\"Where's Moons?\" he asked.\"With your brother,\" James responded glumly.\"WHAT!\" Sirius yelled as he lunged for the map snatching it right out of James's weak grasp.

	"45743299000": "“Did you hear something?” \n“Huh?” James questioned not having heard what Regulus said.Regulus pulled his head back, trying to get James to stop kissing his neck, “I mean it, James. Just- wait, listen.”“Mmm, what is it?” James whispered, lifting his head and looking into Regulus’ eyes.“I heard something.”“You heard something?” James continued whispering, Regulus nodded in answer, “What did you hear?”“I- I don’t know, James. I just heard something.”Smiling slightly and tilting his head, the older boy nudged the younger teasingly. “Are you scared?”Scoffing and rolling his eyes the younger boy answered, “No, but I doubt either of us wants to get caught in this position.”“What position?” James raised his brows, “We’re just standing.”“In a broom closet, after curfew,” Regulus deadpanned, “What if Sirius has realised you’re gone and is looking for you? What would you do if your best friend caught you snogging his brother in a broom closet?”“I don’t even want to imagine that,” James frowned, “He’d kill me.”“Exactly,” Regulus huffed, softly pushing James further from him, “Let’s see what the sound was.”Before Regulus’ hand reached the doorknob James stopped him, pulling him back to his chest and pressing his face into the shorter boy's shoulder. “Why are we going after the sound if we don’t want to get caught? Let’s just stay here, we were having such a good time.”Brushing his fingers through James' hair Regulus whispered, “And when someone opens the door?”“We’ll lock it.”“And if someone knocks on it because they heard something?”James sighed into Regulus’ shoulder, “We’ll put up a silencing charm.”Regulus smiled softly, “No matter how much I enjoy this, James, I won’t be able to relax if we stay.”“Mmm,” James whined, “Fine, we’ll leave. But can I at least come with you?”“Of course,” Regulus scoffed, “We’re going to look for that sound.”James’ head shot up, “What? No, I meant to your dorm.”Regulus backed away and opened the door behind his back, “You can go to my dorm if you want.  I am going to check out what that sound was.”-“I don’t want to sound boring, but can we  please go to your dorm?” James whispered a few minutes after catching up to Regulus. Having decided he couldn’t leave his boyfriend wandering the castle alone at night.“Why?” Regulus looked at James with a teasing smirk, “Are you  scared ?”James scoffed, “No, but I don’t even know what we’re looking for.”“Me neither,” Regulus stopped and turned, looking at James with mischievous eyes, “Makes it all the more fun, doesn’t it?”James stared at Regulus with determination, “I’m glad you’re having fun, love. But I really want to go to your dorm so that we can continue snogging.”The shorter boy stepped closer and raised a brow, “Really?”“Mhmm,”“That sounds nice,” he said, softly stroking the red and yellow tie the older boy was wearing, “But I’m not leaving here without answers.”James didn’t even have time to react before Regulus started walking again, leaving James alone staring down at where Regulus' pale hand had been.Soon enough James caught up and started complaining again, “You can’t tease me-”His whining was interrupted by a hollow sound, like wind pressing through a crack. Both boys stopped dead in their tracks and looked at each other.Regulus smiled excitedly, “Scared, Potter?”“Piss off, Black,” James spat, “What was that?”“A ghost!” Regulus gasped sarcastically.“What?”“Don’t you know?” Regulus questioned at the confused face his boyfriend was wearing. “That’s how muggles think ghosts sound. Like howling, scary moaning,  ohhh .”“Why would they say ‘Ohhhh’ if they can just talk?” James asked.“I don’t know,” Regulus shrugged, “Ask the muggles. Or Lily, she was the one who told me. She described it as sounding like wind on a very stormy night.”“Oh, but now that we know what the sound was, can we go to your dorm?”“Hm, what do you mean?” the shorted boy frowned.“The sound,” James stated as if it was apparent, “Now we know it was the wind. Can we go to bed?”Regulus smiled, “It wasn’t the wind, James. Look outside. It’s completely calm out there.”James did look, and not a single sign of wind anywhere. He sighed, “Fine, let’s continue searching.”Regulus’ smile brightened, “Really? Will you stop complaining?”James grabbed Regulus’ hand and pulled him closer, “I will stop complaining. Now, lead the way.”They continued their walk down the corridor hand in hand, heading straight toward the place they had heard the foreign sound coming from. As they got closer to the corner they started slowing down, quietly checking to see that no one was standing there, then continuing onward.As they got closer to the door of an old abandoned classroom the sound got louder, James could feel his heart in his throat and wanted nothing else but to turn back. But Regulus didn’t stop.“Reggie,” James whispered and tugged on his hand slightly, “Do we really need to go inside?”Halting his steps Regulus turned around, “Wha- wait, are you really scared?”James didn’t meet his eye.“Oh,” the younger breathed, stepping closer to his boyfriend and stroking his cheek, “James, it’s okay. What’s the worst thing that could happen?”“I don’t know,” James mumbled embarrassed, “But- I really don’t like this.”Regulus sighed and pulled him into a hug, “Okay, that’s completely okay. We’ll head to my dorm.”James quickly leaned back and looked at Regulus with confusion in his eyes, “What? But it’s right there.”“Yes,” Regulus smiled, “I could reach out my hand and open this door, and then we’d know what the sound was. But you really don’t like it, and I don’t  have to know. And it’s stopped now so we’d probably not find it anyways.”“I love you,” James whispered softly, “Thank you.”“You don’t have to thank me,” Regulus said, lifting James’ hand and barely brushing his lips against it, “I love you too.”-On the other side of the door sat a disappointed boy, sulking over the fact that their plan hadn’t worked. They’d made sure everything was perfect.Wormtail was going to scratch on the door of the broom closet they were in to attract their attention, when they were out in the corridor Padfoot would make a sound that they were going to follow.They’d continue making sure the two boys were following them down to the old classroom the tallest one was waiting in. And then they’d hide and wait for them to open the door where the tallest would scare them. Then the other two would march in and confront the two boys about their secret  rendezvous. \n - \nThe eldest of the three sped around the statue he’d been hiding behind throwing up his hand in a defeated motion. “What the fuck?”The two boys startled and turned around. “Sirius?” said the younger one.“You were supposed to go inside!”“You were the one who made the sound?” the scared Gryffindor asked.“We all were,” said the short boy after turning back from being a rat.The door opened to the abandoned classroom and the tallest boy came walking out, with his arms crossed and a disappointed expression on his face.“Why would you do that? I’m so confused.”“Me too,” the Slytherin agreed with his boyfriend.The eldest sighed and took a step closer to the couple, “I wanted to scare you. Because you’ve been going behind my back doing- doing-” he motioned between the couple, “whatever the hell this is.” “You know?”“Of course, I know,” the eldest sighed, pulling on his hair before putting it up in a bun, “We all know! You’ve been so obvious about it.”“Yeah, but we only thought you were like snogging, not- not, uhm,” the rat squeaked.“We didn’t think there was love involved,” the dog mumbled, “What the fuck, Prongs?”Prongs frowned, “Padfoot, I- what?”“How long have you been… in love?” Padfoot looked disgusted.“Don’t look so disgusted,” the Slytherin spat, “Three months.”“Three months?!” “Bloody hell.”“Since Christmas?”“Okay,” the boy with the hair said flatly, “You and your little snake are coming back to our dorm and you’re going to tell us everything.”The five boys started walking in silence, the only sound heard in the corridors were their steps and the low mumble of two brothers whispering to each other. “Are you mad?” the younger mumbled.The elder sighed, “No, I’m not.”“You sure?”“Nope,” the younger pulled his hair, “Ow! I- I just want you to be happy. So… I guess- if you’re happy  I  guess  I’m fine with it.”“ Thank you. ” Further down the corridor, a cat was sitting, having heard the voices she’d hurried to try to catch them. But when she arrived they weren’t happy. The cat was curious.She’d listened to the conversation, not understanding what they were discussing.The rat and dog had spoken, and the werewolf had stayed quiet.The stag smelled anxious and the human was frustrated.When they left the old cat stayed, listening to their echoes from further down the corridor.The rat’s outburst made its way to her ears and the cat sighed.\n “You’ve been shagging Sirius’ brother for THREE months, Prongs!” \nMrs Norris let out a breath, turned around and started walking back to her bedroom.

	"45742912000": "Prologue\nSometimes there is no rational explanation for things in the wizarding world. Things, magical things, happen for one reason or another, and their meaning or purpose is not always obvious. Where does magic even come from? Why is magic inherited for some and not for others? How come some animals, objects or things have magic and others don't?\nWhy is some magic considered as dark magic and some not, even though they can cause just as bad destruction? The study of magic is ever changing, unstable and far from scientific, and it does not always provide reasonable answers to questions; at least not what you would have hoped to get.\nTo me, who books, straightforwardness, and logic were life-defining values, could not easily accept that the wizarding world was anything but logical, scientific or straightforward.\nHowever, I loved the wizarding world with all my heart, even if I couldn't fully understand all its peculiar mysteries.\nSometimes I wonder what my life would have been like if I hadn't been a witch or gone to Hogwarts when the letter came. Would I have been happy? I believe I would have been if I wouldn't have known that magic did exist. At least my life would have been much easier and safer. No one would have hated me because of impure blood, I wouldn't have lost so many people I loved and cared about, and the world would be logical and understandable. No secrets and mysteries that cannot be answered by books. And my heart would have been safer with ordinary muggle men, in an ordinary world; at least I think so. Now I'll never know.\nI don't regret the wizarding world, quite the opposite. It was the greatest love of my life. And I wouldn't give it up or change it, even though I now know the price of that love and what that love would eventually mean to me. The wizarding world with its unexpected mysteries would change the foundations of my world, my understanding, my magic, my love and my soul forever.\nAnd it all started that night when the last of the Death Eaters still on the loose attacked the Ministry of Magic.\n\n1.\nSilently wiping away a few tears, I dropped the kitchen knife from my hand and then turned back to face Ron.\n“I can't bear to argue about this again, Ron. We're just going around in circles.\"\nWe were cooking when an argument started about the same thing that all of our recent arguments had started. We had only seen each other a few times in the last couple of months, even though we lived together. We had both agreed to spend the evening together and talk about us. However, the conversation ended in the same way as always lately when we talked, i.e. an argument.\nOur jobs took up both of our time and Ron wanted us both to work less and spend more time at home together. The problem was that I didn't want to cut back on work. I loved my job and I knew I had way too much work load for one person, but I couldn't figure out how to reduce them any more without my work suffering significantly.\nI was working at the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures, and it had been so backlogged for years before me that even with my current working hours I couldn’t help everyone.\nRon stared angrily at the wall behind me, refusing to meet my gaze. We are both so frustrated with the situation, but in such different ways. I was tired and sad and Ron was angry and bitter.\nRon let out a strained sigh and finally turned his gaze to me.\n\"So you choose your job. As always.\"\nNow it was my turn to sigh and rubbed my tired face. I looked around the kitchen, wishing I could go to sleep already. Or read a book. Or really anything other than this.\nI remembered when we moved into our apartment that I was so excited about our new shared apartment, but now it seemed to be a symbol of the state of our relationship. Our flat was small and we hadn't decorated it much. The green plant that Harry gifted us as a housewarming gift had already died more than half a year ago, but it was still on the kitchen table, as if waiting to be revived. The walls were empty dull beige and the couch we bought had barely been sat on even once. We even slept in different rooms since last month, when after a fight Ron had angrily moved his things there and now slept there on an air mattress, to which he complained about the squeaking noise every time, but still refused to change rooms.\n\"Maybe… I don't know, but I just can't take this anymore,\" I admitted after a long silence.\nThe silence between us was excruciatingly painful. I still felt a strange sense of completion and relief when I had finally said out loud what I really wanted. I could see it in Ron's eyes that he saw it too.\n“Are you happy Ron? I can’t remember the last time I was happy and I know you feel the same way. We just can’t make this work, can we?\"\nRon fiddled with his shirt sleeve for a long time before looking up at me. His face was resigned and sad and a single tear glistened on his cheek.\n\"I know I love you,\" Ron said quietly.\n\"I love you too. So much, but—”\n\"Maybe I haven't been very happy lately either,\" Ronin interrupted and stared apathetically at the wall behind me. I looked at Ron and bit my lip uncertainly. My heart was pounding and I felt tears streaming down my cheeks.\n“What do you want, Ron? I can't go on like this anymore.\"\nRon and I looked at each other with tears in our eyes.\n\"Maybe it's time we split up,\" Ron murmured.\nI sniffed loudly and nodded. \"Perhaps.\"\nWe were both silent for a long time, unable to say anything.\nRon had been grumpy and serious at home lately, and I couldn't remember the last time I'd seen him laugh. I don't know if it was me or his work, but either way the change in him broke my heart. He used to be so smiley and easygoing, but now his freckled face had a perpetual grim look whenever he was around me. I remember how during an argument months ago he had yelled at me that he couldn't remember the last time he had any fun spending time with me. I was deeply hurt by his words at the time and we didn't speak to each other for a week, but now I understood how he felt because I felt the same way. And I didn't want to be in a relationship where neither of us felt joy in the other's company anymore.\n\"I think I'm going to live with my parents for a while and start looking for a new apartment,\" Ron grumbled.\n\"Okay,\" I said, \"I'll start looking for a new apartment too.\"\n\"You can stay here if you want,\" Ron said quietly, avoiding my gaze.\n“No, I… this is too expensive to live alone.”\nWe fell into silence again. Anxiety slowly crept up on me. I felt like I was going to lose Ron completely. I opened my mouth in desperation.\n“We just don't seem to be happy when we are together, no matter how much we want to,” I spoke hastily, “but Ron, I still love you now and always, and that's not going to change. I still want to be your friend, because I can't bear the thought of us not being in each other's lives at all.\"\nTowards the end of my words, my words turned into a sobbing mumble that even I couldn't make out, but Ron still seemed to understand and he pulled me into a hug.\n\"Now don't be silly. Of course we are still friends. Now and always, Mione,” Ron said softly into my hair as I sobbed into his shirt and hugged him back with all my might.\nI don't know how long we were like that before Ron pulled away, his auror alarm buzzing softly between us. The sight was so familiar that I knew right away that he was being called to work. The only strange thing was that he was supposed to have the evening off today, which he had specifically requested so that we could talk in peace. I guessed that the situation would have to be bad if even the aurors who were free were called.\nBack in the day, when Ron and Harry had just started as aurors, I had found it amusing the little metal bell that alerted the aurors when they were needed, because it reminded me of the muggle doctor's call devices. Ron glanced at the device and frowned in confusion.\n\"What?\" I asked.\n\"The Department of Mysteries at the Ministry has been attacked.\" Ron had a startled look and fear on his face and my heart jumped with fear.\n“What… who? Death Eaters?”\n\"Who else,\" Ron grunted, glancing at me with a hard-to-decipher look on his face, \"I've got to go.\"\n\"Be careful,\" I murmured quietly as I looked after him. I had the weirdest feeling of him leaving tonight but I didn’t want to burden him with my worries.\nRon hurried towards the door, summoning the traveling cloak from the chair with accio as he did so, and then he stopped.\n“Do you want to come too? If there's a big attack there, we might need all the help we can get.\"\nRon didn't even get to finish his sentence when I already called for a coat and quickly pulled it on. I didn't usually dress up in muggle clothes when I went to the ministry, but now was an exception. I knew right away from the look on Ron's face that the attack on the ministry was bad.\nWe stepped outside our apartment in the muggle suburbs of London and as soon as we were outside, I grabbed Ron's hand and we apparated at the entrance to the Ministry of Magic.\nNot many of the Death Eaters hadn’t been caught by the Aurors, like Ron and Harry, who had been working hard for the last four years to catch the last ones. However it had proved to be a difficult task though, as the Death Eaters and their cause still had silent supporters, even after the war was over and Voldemort was gone. Purebloods supported each other.\nAs soon as we entered the ministry, we ran to the elevator leading to the Department of Mysteries. Harry and two aurors unknown to me ran from the floo fireplaces to the elevator at the same time as us.\n\"What has happened?\" Ron snapped. Harry's expression was tense but determined. The look was so familiar to me after all these years. It was his battle expression. I could feel the adrenaline pumping through my veins and I realized from a distance how much I had missed it. Fighting evil and showing off my skills. Although I loved my job, it wasn't really very exciting.\n\"A couple of dozen Death Eaters attacked the Department of Mysteries but the reason is unknown,\" Harry said breathlessly and then glanced at me with a frown, \"why did you bring Hermione? She shouldn't be here.”\n\"We need all the help we can get,\" Ron grinned lamely. Harry opened his mouth to argue back, but I talked first.\n“Don't start it, Harry! If the ministry has been attacked, you need all the extra help you can get. Haven't I proven that I'm more than capable of fighting Death Eaters, even though I'm not an auror,\" I growled between my teeth and scolded Harry, who was always so brave and imagined that he could do all the fighting alone, without endangering others. However, I was tired of him always patronizing.\nMaybe there was also a little bitterness in me that Harry and I had drifted apart when Ron and I had our relationship crises. It had hurt almost as much as seeing Ron being so unhappy with me.\nFortunately, I had Ginny, who I could talk to about things, but I didn't even want to think about how awkward it would be for all four of us now that we were breaking up with Ron. Harry and Ron were best friends and had been even closer after working as aurors and Ginny was Ron's sister and Harry's fiancé.\nHarry shot Ron an accusing glare, but Ron just shrugged dismissively. Harry had taken his work as an auror very seriously when he joined the ministry. He was working hard to clean up the corruption and the misdemeanours, but he sometimes seemed to forget who he had once fought with to destroy Voldemort.\n\"How come there are suddenly dozens of Death Eaters?\" I pressed.\n\"They've recruited more people,\" Ron informed grimly, despite Harry giving him a warning glare. I was about to open my mouth again to ask more when the elevator door opened to complete chaos in the Department of Mysteries.\nAurors and Death Eaters fought along the corridors as lights of magic flickered around them. Harry and I immediately casted shield charm on us and the stunning spell hit the shields in a flash. Ron and I exchanged startled looks. Harry purposefully stepped out of the elevator, casting spells at an amazing rate at the Death Eaters behind the masks while expertly dodging the ones aimed at him. The aurors already in the corridor looked relieved to see Harry, who after Voldemort's death was almost a saint in the wizarding world.\n\"Go help Robards in the death chamber!\" someone yelled at us. Ron and I started running, taking turns blocking and throwing curses at each side. Harry stayed to fight with the other two aurors in the corridor. I threw a startled glance in Harry's direction, but Ron pulled me tightly with him.\n\"We were told to go ahead, more help is needed there!\" Ron shouted.\nThe death chamber was in even worse chaos if possible. Witches and wizards fought there so bloody and ferociously that it was hard to tell who was winning, if neither. There were a few bodies lying on the ground, but it was hard to tell if they were dead or even if they were Death Eaters or Aurors. Fierce screams and howls of pain echoed throughout the chamber and in the center of the chamber stood the stone archway that shone eerily. The Veil I realized. I stared at it in disbelief and confusion. How was it so different from when I saw it before?\n\"You take the left side,\" Ron ordered, snapping me out of my daze. I nodded at him, but he was already charging towards the death eater.\n****\nLestrange magic flashed green and I narrowly dodged it. I staggered back and my leg bent painfully, but I luckily didn’t fall. Lestrange hadn't even bothered to mask his face like the other Death Eaters had done. He had viciously attacked me when he saw me fighting with two other Death Eaters. I had managed to stun one of the Death Eaters, but Lestrange and the other Death Eater were not so easily defeated.\nNext to Lestrange, the death eater who was also fighting against me, aimed at me with a curse I didn't know before and it slammed into my shield charm with a loud thud.\n\"Stupefy,\" I screamed and the death eater flew as the magic hit him so hard and didn't get up again. However, I didn't have time to sigh of relief when Lestrange attacked.\n\"Time to get rid of you, you mudblood whore,\" Lestrange growled in disgust and looked at me almost hungrily and partly like I was a pile of garbage.\nI hurriedly hit another stunning spell, but it didn't go anywhere near the target. My heart was beating wildly, but with a quick glance I could see that the Death Eaters were losing the battle. I felt a smile creep across my face. Strangely, I concluded that the smile was due to stress more than genuine joy.\nMy smile didn't last long. Lestrange's curse hit me before I could dodge it. Curse felt like a thousand stabs when it hit me and knocked me on my back hard. My head thumped painfully and my vision went completely black for a moment and I heard distorted sounds in my ears. Pain spread all over my body and I felt warm blood start to flow uncontrollably all over my body.\nI couldn't wrap my head around what was happening and what I should do. I searched for my wand while coughing up blood. I would die if I didn't do something soon. However, I couldn't find the wand. It had bounced out of my hand when the curse hit me. I turned off my back with difficulty and looked for Harry or Ron, but the people fighting around me moved strangely slowly like in a blur so I couldn't make out who they were.\n“Help,” I croaked desperately as blood spewed from my mouth.\n\"I don't think anyone will help you, mudblood,\" said a snarky voice behind me, but I didn't turn to look. I ignored whoever was talking and started crawling forward. The rocks beneath me hurt and went into the deep gashes in my stomach, but I didn't care. The only thought in my head was that I had to escape or I would die.\nVaguely, I made out an archway rising up ahead, which glowed darkly and faintly silvery. The Veil. I wondered how different it looked from before. I was also confused at how unusually mushy my brain felt. I couldn't catch where my thoughts started and ended and what was important and what wasn't. I could almost feel logical thoughts fleeing my head and all that was left was pain and despair.\nThe Veil flowed silky, almost invitingly, and gave me a strange power to approach it, even though I was on the brink of death. I heard soft singing from the other side of the Veil. I hadn't heard any talk from it or seen the Veil in the empty archway, as Harry had later described it to me, when I last visited the chamber five years ago, but now it sang to me and shone more beautifully than anything I had ever seen.\n“Time to die, mudblood.”\n\"No,\" I sobbed.\nI don't want to die, I thought desperately. And I wouldn't die. I pulled myself with all my strength towards the Veil, which had been dangerously close to me when I had fighted. The Veil sang softly and the voice was comforting. I heard an unpleasant laugh and felt someone grab my leg, so I weakly stretched out my trembling hand to touch that ethereal Veil as my last act. I wasn't ready to die, at least not for this, at the hands of that Death Eater. The sounds around me disappeared as soon as my fingers hit the dark waves of the Veil and only the singing of the curtain could be heard. I felt the last shreds of my body give out as someone called my name in the distance.",
	"45742879000": "The first time I met Sebastian was in our common room. He seemed to be examining a book that looked rather intriguing. When I pressed further, he re-directed the conversation. Since that day, we were best friends. Through thick and thin, we stuck by each other, and even battled a troll. All was well. He was someone I could confide in, on my journey at Hogwarts and the Scottish Highlands around it. Then the day came that I wanted it to be become more.\nOne night, I returned to the common room, roughed up, enveloped in pain. The prefects were doing their nightly rounds in the halls, leaving the common room completely empty. Or so I thought. I sat on the couch, trying to hold in any vocalisation caused by my injuries.\n\"Aura, my God, are you okay?\" It was Sebastian.\nIt was just after my first trial, after the adrenaline had worn off. Fighting an giant ancient magic guardian had taken its toll on me. Thank god the keepers weren't here to see me.\n\"I just....\" was all I could get out before I started to cry.\n\"Shhhh, it's okay,\" Sebastian took hold of me in his arms.\nAll the tension in my body ceased. There I sobbed, as all the events up until now had finally caught up to me. I was constantly within an inch near death, whether by Ranroks hands or the Keepers. My body and mind was bruised and exhausted. I didn't know how long I could keep going like this.\nI cried into Sebastian's chest.\n\"I don't know how much longer I can do this,\" I let out a muffled cry.\n\"Who did this to you?\" He asked.\n\"It was the keepers trial. Their guardians,\" shakily.\n\"For Christ sake. They want you protect the magical repositories but they beat and batter you?\" Sebastian's voice grew angry.\nHe was right. They wanted me to carry on their legacy, yet it came at a great price.\nI dug myself deeper into chest. Sebastian could sense my body language and held me harder. Somehow he knew I needed to feel secure. He rubbed my back, letting my sob until I couldn't any longer. I shifted out of his grasp.\n\"Better?\" He asked.\nI nodded.\nSebastian sat with me until we heard a prefect enter the common room. We cast a disillusionment charm before parting ways and I collapsed into bed. As I recalled the nights events, with Sebastian being the sole focus. It was in this moment I knew, how much I loved this boy.",
	"45742879001": "The next day, when I saw Sebastian, I was forced to come to terms with the feelings I had to towards him. I couldn't just ruin a good friendship because of it. Sebastian merely asked if I was okay, then proceeded to go about his life. He had no idea how much I held onto that special moment we shared, and he wasn't going to know. I had a bigger role to play, boys weren't my number one priority, understanding ancient magic was, and I was determined to keep it as that. Of course, that was easier said than done.\nThe moment I caught any other girl eyeing Sebastian, I felt the serpent come out in me. I don't know if he noticed, I suspected Ominis did. That boy always had a sixth sense for people emotions. Or perhaps everyone could see. Everyone except Sebastian. I began letting my focus shift, and my emotional turmoil soon got the better of me. I did the only thing I knew how to do. Distance myself.\n\"Aura, wait up!\" Sebastian ran after me.I hastened my speed.\"Jesus. I'd think you're trying to avoid me,\" he said when he finally caught up.I laughed as naturally as possible.\"Where have you been? I've barely had two words with you in two days outside of class.\"Was he counting how long I hadn't spoken to him for? Surely not.\"I've just been working with the keepers a lot lately,\" I said.\"Aura wait,\" he tugged my sleeve prompting me to stop. \"Have you forgotten the position you were in only two weeks ago? Be careful.\"I signed, examining the tension on his face. He genuinely seemed concerned for me, and all I could think about was my feelings for him.\"Don't worry about me. I'll be fine,\" I smiled and walked off as fast as I could.I didn't look back.\n————————\nOver the coming week, all attempts Sebastian had made to speak to me, were masterfully evaded. I found the only way to completely avoid him was focusing on training my magic. During classes, I still sat with Sebastian but I buried my head in books, and after school, I explored the Scottish Highlands. The world truely felt like my oyster. This is what I was mean't to do. Out here, I was well and truely free. My adventures took me from battling Ranroks loyalists, to rescuing beasts from poachers. I could feel the power bursting out of me. There was only one problem. I still had homework.\nWhat I couldn't do in class, I spent nights and lunch breaks attempting to catch up. While I was more of a practical learner, I couldn't fail my theoretical tests. One particular evening, I sat in the common room, revising over notes on magical history. I would catch Sebastian glancing over to me, then quickly diverted my attention back to studying. He didn't approach. Sebastian was always too courteous to disturb me when I was busy. Although that didn't stop him from trying something more elaborate to get my attention.\"Sebastian, you wanted to study together?\" I heard a familiar feminine voice speak within earshot.My head jerked in that direction. It was Imelda Reyes. The green eyed monster resurfaced. Sebastian knew I loathed her, and he wasn't exactly a fan of her either. We both used to gossip about her during classes. Why he wanted to study with her was beyond me.I watched the pair of them study, with Imelda laughing at every joke he made, my heart sinking little by little.Sebastian and I made eye contact a more few times, before I slammed my book shut and left the common room.I went to the library to study before curfew, mind wandering to what I had witnessed.I felt small. Then logic set in. This was good. Maybe I could forget about him. Of course, that wasn't what I wanted.",
	"45742879002": "I sat in the Undercroft, preparing to practice Bombarda. I didn't know why I was there. Part of me needed to just be somewhere Sebastian and I would spend so much time. Practicing combat eased my mind a little. It help me set my mind on the goal, even if part of me didn't know what that was anymore.\"Aura?\" I heard a voice come from behind me. There was only two people it could be, and it wasn't Sebastian.\"Ominis, what are you up to?\"\"I just needed to be alone,\"  he said.\"Oh, I'm sorry. I'll leave.\"\"No. No need. It's okay. There's something I've been meaning to speak to you about anyway.\"\"Oh?\" I asked.He nodded.\"What's going on with you and Sebastian? He seems really concerned about you and you seem to have been distancing yourself from him lately.\"\"Oh, I've been busy,\" I said.Ominis shook his head, \"Aura, we both know that isn't true. I can tell when people are lying.\"\"You have always been very emotionally aware,\" I said.\"That's was trauma can do to a person,\" he said quietly.I sat there silent for a moment.\"Ominis, you're Sebastian's best friend. I can't exactly confirm or deny what you've said. I don't know if I can trust you for one....\"\"Aura, I would never betray what someone tells me in confidence.\"\"But why? Are you genuinely concerned about me? Because if you are, I don't see why. It's not like I told you all my secrets and vice versa. You've only ever seen the surface of this facade,\" I said, my mind was blaring.Then, I realised, how harsh I had just sounded.\"You're right Aura. You have no reason to trust me. But I do care about Sebastian, and I know he's hurt. He would never admit that to me, but I can tell,\" he said calmly.I felt unnerved. How was he so composed? Especially after I had just been an asshole to him.Ominis hit a nerve. Suddenly, I couldn't stop myself from crying.\"I just can't do this. Everything. I'm overwhelmed, physically and emotionally,\" I sobbed.\"It's okay Aura. It will pass. Recognise that you're doing your best and what's happening now won't be forever,\" he said softly.\"I can handle being beaten by dark wizards, heck even a troll. The mental toll everything at Hogwarts is taking on me is too much,\" I cried.Ominis sat down next to me.\"It's okay, you can vent all you need.\"He sat there beside me, simply listening, and offering input whenever I needed it. It was in that moment I had realised, that I found a friend in Ominis.\n———————\nOminis and I stepped into the elevator that allowed us to exit the undercroft. It was a little cramped but since curfew was in 10 minutes, we really didn't want to risk getting caught. Up we went, and a few seconds later, the elevator jolted to a stop. I pushed open the door and stepped out of the clock, turning to face Ominis. Just as he was about to lift his other foot out, he tripped, stumbling into me. Ominis pinned me into the wall with a thud.\"What in the bloody hell is going on here?\"My eyes shot to my right.There stood Sebastian, watching me and Ominis, taking the situation completely out of context. It must've looked like we were in an embrace.We quickly separated.Blood rushed to my face, and my mind went dizzy in a panic.\"What are you doing here?\" I blurted out. Immediately realising how much more suspicious it made this look.\"Why shouldn't I be here? The real question is, what are you TWO doing?\" He asked in a huff.\"Oh Sebastian, don't get ahead of yourself, I just tripped,\" Ominis said.\"Likely story,\" Sebastian said as he stormed off in another direction.Ominis signed. \"I can try talking some sense into him but it will be better if it comes from you,\" he said.\"Ominis....I can't,\" I looked at the floor.\"Very well, good night Aura. If you need to talk my door is always open,\" Ominis said. Then he left.I stood there alone for a few moments, processing what had just happened.",
	"45742879003": "The inevitable happened. I thought I may have been imagining it when I saw Sebastian and Imelda together. Now, my fears were confirmed. The gossip around school was that they were going on a date in Hogsmeade. I couldn't ask Ominis. It would be too obvious. All I could do was attempt to tame the green eyed monster, and it wasn't going to be easy.\n———————\nA couple days had passed since Sebastian had seen the incident between me and Ominis. The entire school was abuzz with the latest gossip that the most attractive fifth year boy was going on a date with the Slytherin Captain. Somehow it managed to reach my ear countless times a day. Finally, I retreated to the Room of Requirement, needing an escape. It was the only place that truely felt like mine, and well, Derek's. I only went left my the room for classes, meals, and exploring the highlands. It also helped that I had managed to conjure a bed in there. I often wondered if my room mates grew curious of where I would sleep at night. But I couldn't share a dorm with Imelda. Every time I saw her, I'd think of the date they'd be going on.What dug the knife even deeper, was that Sebastian stopped any attempts to speak to me. Imelda was now his sole focus. Although, I couldn't blame him, I didn't even want to be in my presence.He'd sit with Imelda during class, leaving Ominis and I.\"I didn't cause a rift between you two, did I?\" I asked.It was a perfectly valid question after he saw us the other night.\"No, I just don't like Imelda,\" Ominis laughed.\"I can't imagine why. She's a peach,\" I said sarcastically.I looked over at them.\"Why are they hanging out together?\" The question escaped my mouth.Ominis signed. \"I don't know. You know Sebastian, if somethings bothering him, he keeps it in instead of talking about it. My guess is this is his way to cope.\"I nodded. \"He does, until he has a meltdown. But honestly me too. That's why we got along so well.\"It was true. We had always bottled up our issues, until we had to let it escape. Sebastian was the only one I could confide in and show that side of me to, because he had done the same.Ominis could sense me pouting.\"Chin up. Everything will work out in the end,\" he said.\"You know what would cheer me up. A trip to Hogsmeade this Saturday,\" I said cheerily.\"Good idea!\" Ominis matched my enthusiasm.\n———————\nFriday came and went. I woke up Saturday around noon. Late the previous night I had been taking down a dragon fighting ring with Poppy. My muscles ached and I had bruises all over my body. The teachers would surely get suspicious. I studied in the Room of a Requirement until 4pm, which was when Ominis and I had agreed to leave. When the time came, I threw on a pair of blue pants, a white quarter sleeve button up shirt, and a brown corset. Then I added some knee high boots to match.Not long after, I met Ominis in the common room. He wore brown slacks and jumper, which probably wasn't the most appropriate for the warm weather that day.We took the Floo Flame to the town square in Hogsmeade.The cozy atmosphere filled my lungs. Hogsmeade looked as if it was straight out of a storybook.\"Care for a butterbeer?\" I asked.\"Sounds perfect,\" he nodded.Ominis and I walked to the Three Broomsticks. We sat at the most secluded area of the tavern and Sirona brought us our butterbeer.I recalled the events previous night, and even opened up about the Keepers.\"Well you've certainly been busy,\" he said.I nodded.\"You know I've never told anyone but you and Sebastian,\" I said.\"No wonder you broke down the other night.\"Ominis just knew. He could see right through me. I don't know why I hadn't spoken to Ominis sooner. He was an incredibly kind and caring person. I could see why him and Sebastian were so close.\"Yeah, it's all a bit much. Isn't it?\" I laughed.I sipped my butterbeer and Ominis shared parts of his past.\"Sebastian mentioned something about that,\" I said.\"He really told you everything, huh?\" He asked.\"I'm sure he didn't think you'd mind.\"\"Still, he never shared what you told him to me,\" Ominis said slowly.\"Ominis, you know you can trust Sebastian. He wouldn't....\" I stopped mid sentence.My eyes jolted to the large wooden doors at the front of the tavern.Sebastian and Imelda had walked into the Three Broomsticks.Imelda wore a beautiful light blue dress. As for Sebastian, he wore grey slacks, with a white button up shirt that hugged his frame nicely.I froze.\"Aura?\" Ominis asked.\"It's Sebastian,\" I whispered.As soon as Sebastian noticed us, he approached.\"What are you guys doing here?\" He asked.\"Just some butterbeer between friends,\" Ominis replied.\"Well, I guess you won't mind if we join you then,\" he said.I glanced at Ominis. He stiffened. Neither of us wanted to deal with Imelda.Sebastian's eyes moved between both of us.\"By all means,\" Ominis said.Imelda groaned and sat beside me. It was clear she didn't want to be there.The four of us sat there awkwardly, and I suddenly became hyper aware of how I was casual dressed compared to Imelda.\"What have you both been up to?\" Ominis asked, breaking the silence.\"Strolling through the gardens at Hogsmeade,\" he said.\"Interesting, I didn't take you for enjoying that kind of activity Sebastian,\" Ominis teased.\"Clearly you don't know him,\" Imelda snarked.I looked at her. Did she really just say that to Ominis?\"And who's idea was it exactly Imelda?\" I asked.\"Hmph, mine,\" she said.Ominis and I gave a laugh. I even thought I saw Sebastian smile.Imelda was not pleased.\"Well, at least I'm not from a nobody wizarding family and starting at Hogwarts my fifth year. You know, there's rumours going around as to why. Maybe because you're not from a wizarding family after all?\"She cocked an eyebrow.My heart dropped. It felt as if a knife had entered my gut. Was it that obvious? I thought I had been holding my own but clearly that didn't matter. People will still have something to say regardless.Sebastian watched me, mouth agape. Ominis had a similar look on his face.\"I..... don't know what you're talking about,\" I said.Suddenly, I felt as if all eyes were on me.\"I have to go,\" and I stood up, leaving without another word.\"Aura, wait....\" Ominis shouted after me.As if I needed more reason to hate Imelda.",

	"45742675000": "Many people asked why James thought Regulus was the one he wanted to be with. Then later they wondered how he knew he was the one for him. He never gave a proper answer because he had no idea. He couldn't come up with a reason. Partly because he had no particular reason in the first place, and partly because even if he had, he wouldn't have been able to put it into words. It was not something he could just tell. He had tried many times, but he could never get it right, because it was impossible to explain what he saw in him, how he recognised his feelings and why he felt anything for him in the first place. Other than pity. Other than platonic love. What has he thought before he pulled himself together and confessed to him?He couldn't mention the colour of his hair because it wasn't that special. He couldn't mention his manners or his sense of humour because they were all qualities that attracted the attention of others and made more people like him almost as much as James liked him. He was trying to come up with something that only he could see. Something beautiful, something good. But for a while, he couldn't think of anything other than what everyone noticed. And then, when he finally realized what it was that bound him to Regulus, he realized that it was neither beautiful nor good. It was love. Yes. But the worse kind. The one that makes someone do stupid things and causes more trouble. The one that makes you blind, not seeing what's right in front of you.So after a while he didn't even try to explain. Not to his friends, not to his family. No one. He decided to keep Regulus as a treasure, to keep his love, which he gave him as much of as he could. Regulus kept it, looked after it, and returned it in his own way, for which James would be forever grateful, even if Regulus would never know it. Or perhaps he always had.He hoped he had.-Regulus, when James first saw him, was quiet, young and beautiful. He smiled when his brother, Sirius, showed him something on his phone. He had just arrived at the restaurant where they were waiting for him, where he was about to introduce himself to Regulus that day, as a former classmate from college and a friend of Sirius.Much to James’ dismay, Regulus did not react as he had expected. He was such a beautiful sight that he made others want to live, and James was happy to extend his hand to him, even though he was afraid that if Regulus accepted the gesture, he would feel his nervousness and the sweat on his palm.James didn't like him at the time. He just found him interesting. Then that feeling passed for a moment before it resurfaced again, as Regulus didn't shake his hand, but instead waved, covered his smile and continued to watch Sirius silently. James looked at him. Then he looked at Sirius. Regulus didn't say a word the whole time. He nodded occasionally, but when their food was brought out to them, he ate conspicuously quickly, as if he was very hungry and only had this one chance to eat. James didn't want to disturb him, he and Sirius started talking about nothing, like the new sofa he'd bought that morning and the tuition fees they both had to pay back to the university.Regulus ate all the while. James first started to worry a little when he drank the Coke in front of him in one gulp and didn't even care that the carbonation was making his throat sore and his eyes water. For a moment James’ heart sank. In that moment, he saw him as not only beautiful, but pitiable, even though that wasn't his intention. He knew that if Regulus suspected what he thought, he would be hurt, so James tried not to think of him that way.Later, after Regulus had said goodbye, his brother came to his defence. James listened silently as Sirius talked about him, as if he were someone who urgently needed to be saved from prejudice. He remembers exactly what Sirius said even now, to this day he can't forget it.\"He's a bit scared of you, but don't worry! He's scared of everyone until he gets used to them,\" the first sentence echoed in his head as Sirius continued talking \"He had a much harder time than I did.\"\"What do you mean?\"He knew about the Black brothers' troubled childhood, but not about who suffered or did not suffer more than the other.\"Sorry I can't...I can't tell you.\"\"Oh, I-\"\"Regulus won't talk about it either.\"Sirius ended the conversation with the kind of emphasis that could almost slap someone in the face. Regulus won't talk about it either. As if it was a crime to even think that James would ever know his story. Not that he'd been that curious about it at the time, but Sirius' behaviour had piqued his interest for a few hours. But then the next morning, when he woke up, he hadn't felt the need to find anything out.Probably not going to see him again anytime soon, it was an exceptional day.When he thought back to that morning, he had to laugh at himself. Naively, he poured his tea and shook off the image of Regulus devouring his lunch. He ignored it, he had been working that day, visiting his grandparents and two former roommates from college.Then a few days went by, two weeks to be exact, and everyone got Christmas fever. People were carrying home pine trees, ornaments and cookies by the dozen. James was so overwhelmed with work that he didn't even think to buy a Christmas tree. His job meant he couldn't spend the holidays with his family, because they were away on Wednesday, the 20th, and he couldn't go with them because he was so busy.So he decided that he could celebrate alone, if not with them. That day he arrived home late at night. He didn't want to leave the apartment, but somehow, he managed to bring himself to do it, and half an hour later he was walking towards the Christmas tree shop with a bundle of postcards. He wanted a small tree, but just as he was about to pay for it, he heard his voice from behind the tree seller.\"Sorry, I-\"\"What do you want, boy?\" a large, middle-aged man snarled at Regulus as if he already knew the sin he had committed.As Regulus pointed at the tree, trying to force some words out of himself, James had an inkling of what was to come. To relieve the tension (especially Regulus') he began to shake his head with a smile, indicating that he had no problem if this tree had already been set aside for someone else, because any other would do.\"Sorry,\" Regulus bowed his head, and then as James was about to start walking home with a taller and less shapely tree, he stopped in his tracks at the insufferable, blatant roar of the tree-seller, who was hurling every curse word he could think of straight at Regulus. Without thinking, James went back. It felt as if he had been struck by lightning. Immediately, without hesitation, he asked for another tree, and was conspicuously embarrassed at not having thought of going home carrying the both of them, so, to Regulus's utter dismay, he asked for help.\"I live two blocks away,\" he added, then looked at the tree-seller, \"I hope that's okay.\"\"Take him,\" the man snapped, waving towards Regulus without looking at him. As if he were a piece of junk, an unwanted object that one wanted to get rid of as soon as possible, at any cost. Two minutes later they were each carrying a pine tree. The boy was walking beside James, not daring to look at him, and he was afraid Regulus wouldn't even breathe unless he absolutely had to. At one of the red lights, James smiled and Regulus caught his eye. The older one thought he really had to leave it at that, but when he looked at Regulus again, he saw his face looked much brighter than before. He wasn't smiling, but he didn't look so tense either. James counted that as a success. Regulus seemed like a nice boy. Who doesn't have a bad word to say to anyone. Who couldn't hurt a fly. Someone who would do anything to meet expectations. He probably doesn't have a steady job, and this Christmas market is temporary. In himself, James was already looking for solutions for him, even though he had nothing to do with Regulus. He had saved him from the wrath of the tree seller not because he wanted to change his life, but because he simply felt sorry for him. Again. But still, he had very little to do with him. Moreover, Regulus had a brother. The person who should have helped him in the first place was Sirius.\"How long do you have to be there?\" the question slipped out of James’ mouth for some reason, and he jerked his head towards Regulus, who, in the next moment opened his mouth to speak and answered properly. He said that he was only working until tomorrow evening, after which he would be relieved by the tree-seller's son, who was abroad for those two days.\nMore temporary than I thought.\n\"So you're going back today?\" he asked, to which Regulus said yes, but he could clearly see in his face that he didn't want to go \"You're getting paid well for that manners, aren't you?\" he was referring to the wood-seller here, and then for the first time he saw real shame on Regulus' face \"What?\" he didn’t hear the answer very clearly.\"I wouldn’t say that,\" he whispered, standing at the stairwell entrance. He didn't seem likely to come much further if he didn't have to, but James had made up his mind that he wasn't going to let him back to that man. He doesn't even pay him properly. And the way he talked to Regulus...No. He couldn't swallow that, however much they were strangers to each other and however little he had to do with Regulus' life.He stood firmly in front of him and asked Regulus to help him set up the two trees. The younger one wanted to make an excuse to go back to the fair, but James asked him again and again to stay. He said that he had probably sprained his shoulder while working, so he would not be able to do it alone, and that putting up the ornaments and the lights was a difficult task with sore shoulders. Regulus didn't want to agree to it either. He stood at the gate as before, only by then he was so embarrassed that he looked as if he might cry at any moment.\"Regulus, look,\" he said to him very quietly, \"They won't pay you. There's no point in you being there to be treated like that. Not to mention how cold it is outside, and you're only wearing a... just this sweater. Good heavens, no! You can't go back like that. You'll get sick.\"“I won’t.\"\"You don't have to do this. Don't let that man treat you like that, you don't deserve it.” he tried to catch Regulus’ eye, but failed so he could only rely on his tone as trying to sound nice and convincing \"I mean it.\"He was worried about him. He was really worried, because despite everything, he really did think Regulus wanted to go back. Then, when, after a long silence, Regulus closed the gate behind himself and sprinkled the staircase with tiny pins, James was overcome with joy. His fingers were no longer numb with cold, his jaw no longer tense with shivering.\nIf I'm this cold, how cold can he be?\nHe did not go back that day. He hadn't even left the apartment. True, he didn't talk much, but he didn't want to leave. Not to the fair, not to Sirius’. James thought at first that if they put up the trees he would find a way out, but he didn't, he just helped himself and accepted the tea he had pushed into his hand in a mug after the first tree was finished. During this time, Regulus never once asked him why he had bought two trees. He probably knew the reason.Sirius said the sofa he bought is ugly. Maybe he was telling the truth. In retrospect, he only bought it because it was the same warm shade as the rest of the apartment and he wanted it to not spoil the overall look. Other than that, yes, it was an ugly sofa, but he still thought it was nice when he went to the kitchen late at night for a glass of water and saw Regulus sleeping on it with the pillow and under the blanket he'd taken out earlier. He has pulled the latter up to his nose, as if to soak up the comfort and warmth of the material. So carefully, not wanting to wake him, James laid another blanket over Regulus before he went back to his room.The next morning, when Regulus woke up, James had made him breakfast, fresh tea and cocoa to choose from. He could see something in his pale face, hiding in his features, but he couldn't yet make it out clearly. James really wanted to be precise about it, not misunderstanding or exaggerating anything.-James thought boys his age should be more relaxed than that. He tried to talk to Regulus, he was genuinely interested, even when he knew he couldn’t get him to talk, because he was buried somewhere deep in his thoughts, and he couldn’t get an answer. He had always known him like that. Always wandering in his own mind, and James would have told anyone without question the moments when Regulus was furthest away.Later it turned out that on such occasions he was seeing his childhood. He cannot control his thoughts, but James never blamed him for that. He couldn't do it, he didn't want to do it. But every time he looked at Regulus, a terrible feeling would come over him.\"Are you okay?\"\"Yeah, I just...is it okay if I...?\"\"Do you want to be alone?\"He knew that was what he wanted. He'd gladly do it for Regulus, walking out of the living room, leaving him standing alone at the kitchen window if that's what he needed. But it was hard for James, he still felt bad for doing it because he'd never seen so much pain gather on one person's face as he saw on his.Knowing how much he was missing from his life, what privileges he'd been deprived of, James wanted to keep Regulus with him even more. He couldn't say that for sure the next morning, but he felt it. It was sticky and thick like honey. It flowed around his heart, through his ribs, covering every bone in his body. He thought Regulus should have been sure that if he was kind and friendly to people, they would return his kindness and friendliness. He should have been sure that James would not be angry if he asked for more breakfast. He should have been sure that it was natural to eat, that it was good to eat, and that eating was often a pleasure, but he wasn't, he couldn't be sure of anything, and James's throat tightened every time he thought about this or the possible reasons for it.He could have sworn Regulus was a good person. When others asked him what he saw in him, and he could never express himself properly, he always regretted not mentioning his goodness. Because Regulus was just plain good, Sirius never had to tell him that after their first encounter was followed by more and more encounters, miraculously. James figured everything out on his own.He had seen Regulus drinking cheap black coffee in a café, walking through a library, squatting in the aisles, piling up books by authors unknown to James. He read them all. Of course, James knew that reading wasn't his only interest, because it turned out that Regulus played the piano beautifully and Sirius said he had once entertained the idea of becoming a pianist, but for some reason he had given it up. He still didn't know why. But Regulus was truly gifted. And good. Very good!\"This is for the stage,\" he pointed to the piano they had found in the corner of a small music shop, on which Regulus had just played half a symphony for fun \"This is talent.\"But Regulus laughed in embarrassment, shook his head and winced, as if to escape the praise before the words caught up with him.\"You are too kind.”\"No, I mean it.\"Three months after they met, he already knew a few things about him. Regulus finally relaxed and shared some information about himself, such as how poorly he had done in the PE classes in high school, how he had broken his wrist at the age of ten (here, for some reason, he felt a terrible compulsion to point out the word accident several times, which eventually became meaningless), and at the age of twenty he had four jobs at the same time, all part-time, but as he was not at university, he found it easier to fit them in.James was already beginning to see Regulus' problem. When asked where he lived, the boy said he lived in many places. James didn't understand at first. Then he realised that Regulus didn't have a stable home, so sometimes he stayed with Sirius (who knew nothing about the whole thing and Regulus asked James to swear not to tell him), and other times at the flat of a friend called Remus or Peter. James told him to stay at his place. Live with him. It didn't matter if he couldn't pay the rent. Regulus didn't agree on this. But he did agree to stay a few nights with him, so he wouldn't be such a nuisance to others.James was happy with that too, although he would have preferred the first option. But then the weeks and months went by. Regulus had been with him more than his own brother. Neither of them resented this, and the sofa, which could never be called ugly again, slowly became Regulus's permanent bed. At the end of the first year after they met, also at Christmas, Regulus was much more cheerful than usual. While James was decorating the Christmas tree, Regulus told him that he had got a very good job in a small, old bookshop.-Things changed a bit from there. James seemed to have gained Regulus' trust this year, for he was no longer reluctant to talk, and more and more often he was the one to initiate the conversations. But what did add a certain strangeness to their situation, and why James couldn't be very happy with how far they'd come, was that Regulus spent every spare moment mopping the floor after it had been cleaned the day before, vacuuming James' room (which he never asked him to do, but Regulus always did) and taking out the rubbish even if the bag was only half full.James was afraid Regulus felt that this is how he had to pay for staying. Later, of course, he realised it was much more than that. The younger boy wanted to distract himself from what he was really doing. Not to think about it. As if by cleaning, he was cleaning himself too.\"What happened to you?\"The thick steam gave the impression of hot showers. Scorching hot ones. Sometimes James could see flushed patches on Regulus's skin, especially around his neck and chin, as if he'd been rubbing it for minutes.\"Oh, nothing, I just scratched a little.\" But James could tell he was embarrassed. \"Are you sure it’s alright? It looks quite painful to me.\"\"Yeah, sure. It’s fine, don’t worry.\"James didn't press the issue any further.He later realised that Regulus was trying to wash away other people's filth and his own self-loathing.Regulus was happy to have the job in the bookshop. He was enjoying his time there, feeling a little braver and a little calmer after two months of paying what he thought was his share of the rent, which, as James had repeatedly pointed out earlier, he should not have had to pay. He did not want him to pay, at all. He wanted Regulus to get better, to talk to him, to tell him things about himself. He didn't say, for example, why he didn't want James to visit him at work during his lunchtime. He would have brought him a sandwich or a pastry, but Regulus kept persuading him until he gave up the idea. He had no intention of forcing himself on him. Rather, the whole situation just made James feel like Regulus needed the company. Even if he didn't say so. Especially because he didn't say. He should have spend more time with people he liked and who also liked him, though Regulus couldn't seem to believe that anybody actually liked him that much. Maybe he believed it with Sirius and his brother’s love was accepted.And he also accepted James' love. Only James didn't know it had already happened.But he had a good time with Regulus. By the middle of their second year, they were cooking together, going out to restaurants, where they were joined by Sirius, Remus and Peter. He got to know Regulus's friends, saw what kind of people they were, saw what kind of person he was through them, or they through him. He was genuinely glad that he never had to waver for a single moment in his belief that Regulus was good.Then, in the second half of the year, things began to go wrong.-A relationship has developed between them. They were friends. James loved him, loved him very much even then, and he was afraid to think about how much it would scare Regulus. He knew he would scare him away with his feelings, so he kept them as safely bottled up as possible, silenced all his confessions and continued to live with him as a simple roommate.A roommate who lied big time, not once, but for almost two years, and James could never stay mad at him, though he was upset that he was unable to cry properly when it turned out Regulus never actually worked at the bookshop.He found this out when he called Sirius one night because Regulus was unavailable and he thought he was staying with his brother. He wanted to talk to him because he had found his new shirt, which he had been looking for the day before, and James had foolishly put it in the washing machine, not knowing why. He didn't even know why he wanted to start the washing machine in the middle of the night, he was just there one moment in in the bathroom, he took the shirt, called Regulus, he didn't answer, then called Sirius, who said he hadn't seen his brother since the last time they had lunch together.He will never blame Regulus for not confessing, for not saying a word about where he is at night when he's not sleeping at Sirius’, Remus’, Peter's or his. He would never have asked him why he said bookshop instead of motel rooms.But he was in one of them. When he came home at dawn, James was angrier than he thought he would be. Then, for the first and last time, he was angry with him because he didn't know the truth yet. He had broken Regulus with his shouting, his curse words, and saying his name so many times.\"Regulus,\" he called as Regulus stood in the living room with both arms around his own body and cried like a little child scolded for daring to steal candy from the convenience store \"Regulus, please! For God's sake! Regulus!\"\"I don't-\"\"Where have you been?\" he was worried sick about Regulus doing something that he didn't yet know, but suspected, was not a good thing. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been so ashamed \"What are you doing, Regulus?\" James could see something on his face that he could finally define. It was clear to see how disgusted Regulus was with what he was about to say.Then he said it. With difficulty, and at first barely intelligible, he said it, and James had to sit down while the younger boy cried at the top of his lungs and squeezed himself harder to keep from falling apart.James asked how long it had been like this.\"All your life? Or...or just a while?\" still stammering from shock \"How often? So far...so far with how many people? And...why?\"Regulus twisted his answers at first. He didn't want to talk, James understood, but he had to know. Not because he'd give him up after having the information, but because he wanted to know how much damage had been done, what they had to somehow repair before it was too late.Nevertheless, James did not consider himself a good man. If he had been, he would have taken Regulus to a doctor. He would have told Sirius. The police. But he couldn't do that, because Regulus was only willing to talk if he swore to keep it a secret. So he gave him his word, even though he knew now that he should have broken his promise for Regulus' sake. Again.The fact that he started only a year and a half ago because he didn't want to be a burden and he had paid all four of their rents with the money he had received for himself, turned James’ stomach. He just watched Regulus, trying not to imagine him in that position, under others, quiet or shouting, crying or uncaring, but he couldn't, involuntarily the images came to him and it was all that much harder because Regulus was still crying and James wondered if he had sobbed like that when he was… working.\"Forgive me!\" Regulus whimpered as he hurried after James, thinking he was going to throw his clothes out of the bathroom and then him out of the apartment, but, of course, that was not the case. Instead, James vomited into the tap until there was nothing left in him but his stomach acid. Then he stepped in front of Regulus. He thought twice about what he would do or say, but it seemed that after what he had learned, his words had to precede his actions.\"Let me...I mean...may I?\" James reached one hand hesitantly towards his face.Regulus's chin quivered.\"Of course.\"But James wasn't stupid, he had an inkling of the damage Regulus could suffer to make money. If he didn't know everything, one thing was not difficult to figure out.\"Are you sure?\"\"You want to do it?\"\"Would you mind if I did?\"\"No, of course not.\"\nOf course not.\n\"Regulus…\"And so it went until James was sure.When it finally happened, he stroked his face. Gently. He barely touched him, and as he did, only one question kept repeating in his mind as Regulus' grey eyes looked right back at him. His face, in another world would have been drenched in tears, but now merely shone with them, as if his already beautiful skin were made of glass.\nIs this what it feels like to have your heart broken?\n\"Yeah, I think it is,\" he said aloud, though Regulus couldn't understand what he meant. He later learned that Regulus had put his face in his palm because no one had ever touched him so gently and he needed to feel it a little more. He didn't regret for a moment that James wanted to touch him.\"Thank you,\" he whispered into his hand, and for the first time since the beginning of their relationship, Regulus reached for him. They pulled themselves to the other at the same time, and Regulus continued to cry, while James tried not to think about the circumstances in which others had seen this body he held in his hands, and what they had done to it, just because he didn't want to be a burden to anyone.Following this, he did not repeat his name because he wanted to get information out of it. It was to reassure him. He whispered, stroking his hair, rocking him from side to side like a baby, and Regulus fell asleep standing up, by which time James had to sit down on the floor, though it wasn't hard to hold him.That was the other thing he wanted to know. What he needed to know.A few days later, after things had calmed down, James asked him why he hadn't eaten more for dinner. It was day six, he hadn't brought any money home for six days. For six days he had not allowed others to take advantage of him. At least he believed him when Regulus said that.James asked the question on the evening of the sixth day, but he didn't give an answer until the one hundred and sixth day. They came back to the subject more than three months later, by which time James felt he had nothing left to crack in his chest. He simply fell silent and listened to Regulus tell him everything.So that's why Sirius said it was worse for him. That's what he was hinting at, outside the restaurant, years earlier. He knew the habits their father had raised them up with, but as it turned out, most of it was applied exclusively on Regulus. \"So that's why you're so thin.\"James looked down at his plate and decided that no one could force him to eat only once a day, regardless of his dizziness and weakness. Not anymore. For twenty-three years he had done this, and he hadn't even lived with his father since he turned eighteen. It was just a bad, ingrained habit.He immediately filled Regulus's plate and they sat at the table for another two hours, because he ate very slowly, but James could see (really, he could see and it tore his heart out again) that he was enjoying every bite, that he made Regulus happy and although Regulus felt guilty because he didn't think he deserved it or food in general, he was happy to comply with James's wishes.When James saw him eat, a part of him was always relieved. He had experienced extreme things with Regulus that, if someone had told him once, he would not have believed. He had loved that boy without knowing him. He took him in, also without knowing him, without knowing what kind of person he was. He brought out something in Regulus that he never would have thought, that Regulus might never have done, if they had never met.The thought that he had, strictly speaking, driven him into what had happened only made the whole situation more unbearable for James.-By taking Regulus in and trying to help him, he believed he was a real man. He felt like a man by his side, not because Regulus was so small and helpless most of the time, of course, but because he thought he made good choices, great choices, and he firmly believed that by swearing secrecy and listening to Regulus, he had changed the boy's life. James didn't know then how wrong he was. He didn't know at the time how wrong he had been to build their whole relationship on his own mistakes.It wasn't until after Regulus' death that he realised.Although to the best of James' knowledge, Regulus never went to motel rooms again, to this day he cannot be sure about that. He had to believe it, that was all he could do. He helped him find a job in a bakery where Regulus would sort the unpacked cakes and sometimes even sell some of them when the person assigned to do so was not there. Regulus said he really enjoyed it because it was easy work and he didn't make many mistakes. James was pleased with his success. Even more, he was glad that they were living without major problems.But Regulus's traumas remained. The ones he'd suffered as a child and the ones he'd gotten from being in the company of men and women waiting for him in motel rooms. He never spoke of these. James would sometimes nudge him. Sometimes he didn't. Sometimes he put a mug of tea in his hand and ordered him to talk. Sometimes he didn't. Now James knows he should have pushed harder, because sooner or later Regulus would have opened up again. He shouldn't have let the disgust, the guilt, the dissatisfaction of not keeping secrets well enough, stick inside him.-This is not about how James confessed to him. That's not the point. There's no need to mention the days when Regulus tried to think of James as his lover, while James didn't even have to try, because it was clear to him that he loved Regulus, that he wanted to be with him, that he would call him his in front of anyone, anytime.After the third year, they were living as a couple. Regulus no longer slept on the couch, but moved into James' room. But they didn't have sex. Never, not once. That wasn't even the goal in the first place, that wasn't what James was trying to achieve, that wasn't what he hoped for. Of course he would have been happy if it happened, because Regulus was gorgeous, but since James didn't see the same thing in him, he didn't push it.Maybe in that sense he really was a man.\"How could your parents give you such a boring name?\" he heard Regulus chuckle. They were lying on the bed, James holding a book in one hand and placing the other in Regulus' lap, letting him do what he wanted with it. He seemed to like this, often drawing tiny circles in the palm of his hand with his cold fingers. „Theirs sounds quite special.”\"I expect nothing less from a boy named after a star,\" James retorted, not looking at him. Hearing this Regulus playfully nipped at his skin and let James kiss him afterwards. He always felt the greatest pleasure when Regulus kissed him back, because he knew he never did it because he felt he had to do it.He loved James.In his own way, he really loved him.-But at the end of the fifth year, on the 31th of December exactly, Regulus cried. For some reason, he cried a lot and James couldn't figure out why. He just rocked him the same way he had before, and watched worriedly as Regulus got dressed, asked for space, and walked out the door, while fireworks and firecrackers were already being set off outside. He was afraid he would get hurt. He was the kind of person James always feared that, even when Regulus gave him no reason to.That day he gave one. He didn't come home. James called him, but he didn't answer the phone. Now he knew he was too late, but that night he went to find Sirius and the others. He asked for help, which he should have done long before, but he was just stupid, believing what he was doing was right, when it wasn't. No one could reach Regulus. By this time, James was clutching his phone in case he called back. At four in the morning, with firecrackers still going off here and there, he ran, shouted, worried, and then stopped, because he was overcome with a feeling that he would never find Regulus again.He had no idea why he felt this way, but the realisation made his body freeze. He sat on the edge of the pavement and cried for Regulus with his teeth buried in the edge of the phone. All he remembered was Sirius' screams and collapse. How Remus and Peter helped them up off the ground. Nothing else.On the fourth day of New Year's Eve, he waited for him to get home. Out of concern. Then on the fiftieth, on the one-hundred and twentieth days, he still did that. Out of habit. If Regulus didn't want to sleep in one room with him, fine. He made his bed on the couch. If he didn't want tea, that was also fine, he got milk and cocoa powder. If he didn't want cooked food, he could manage, he'd bought bread, eggs, vegetables.He couldn't stop thinking about him at work. He couldn't help trying to call him at least twice every single day. Even though he never answered and after a while James knew he never would, he always gave it a try.He still calls him now. Just once a day and every time his phone rings, he hopes it's Regulus, because he's sorry, because he misses James, because he loves him and wants to come home to him. James would have waited with open arms. Anytime.-Now, as he pulls the sofa out of its place for the first time since they met, he sees a folded piece of paper underneath. It was yellowish in color, with a brown stain on the edge, and he remembers spilling his coffee once, but he didn't care enough to look under the couch properly. He wiped it up infront of and a little underneath, but he didn't move it, so the coffee had been soaking and drying Regulus' letter for years, which he wrote to James. Or rather...about James.He had written the same word in it several times. Three hundred and sixty-five times, to be precise, and from the date at the bottom James knew he'd started writing it when they'd become a couple. It was just James’ name. Sometimes in black, sometimes in green pen. That's how he knew Regulus didn't do it in one sitting, but once every day, he took up a pen and wrote.\nDid he leave it here on purpose? Or had he lost it by accident?\nIt didn't matter.Nor did it matter that Regulus had left him. After a while, he thought of him as a dead man, even though there was no proof of Regulus' death. Maybe he was still alive. In another city, in another country, at the other end of the world. He never talked to Sirius about him. At least, not in past tense, as if Regulus was dead, because everyone but James believed he'd run away to start a new life. No one dared say that he might have had an accident, been killed or committed suicide. Because then at least they would have had a body.\nBut what if this is not the case? What if everyone is wrong?\nHe had to think hypothetically, and being hypothetical gave James some comfort, some selfish relief, because he believed that Regulus had died through no fault of his own. That unlike breaking his wrist, it was really an accident. That he had not abandoned him of his own free will. Whatever abandonment means.-There was a point after James really didn't expect a response anymore, he just tried to call him out of habit. He listed everything in his head that they wouldn't have the chance to do together. His stomach kept knotting up, adding more and more items to the list, and after a while James was running out of breath, out of stamina.Because they will never go on holiday together. James won't introduce him to his parents. They won't sleep together for a whole week instead of working. James won't take Regulus to look at new furnitures so they can furnish their new home. He can't argue with Regulus about whether to buy an apartment or a house. He can't argue for one or the other. He can't bring him flowers to work when Regulus turns twenty-seven.He will never open up to James about his traumas, he will never tell him how awful it was to be with so many people, how afraid he was of his father, how worried he was for his brother even though he himself suffered more. James already knew all this, because he had found out himself, but he wanted to hear it from Regulus.James also couldn't ask Regulus to marry him. He could not live a life with him where they would experience a different kind of intimacy. He can't be his husband in a way that they never have sex. James couldn't be with him in a way that gave Regulus the space James knew he needed. He couldn't be his partner in front of, behind and between the strange stares of others for not being in a casual, normal relationship. Whatever it means to be normal when you love someone.James couldn't miss Regulus knowing he would come back to him anyway.He should have asked for help first. He should have called a psychologist. Anyone who knew better and more than he did. But he didn't do that, and when he has nightmares, he always wakes up when he realizes it in his sleep, that he was to blame. Regulus was a grown man, yet James blamed himself for the decisions he made, or never made.-\"How?\" Remus asked one morning when James told him, that yes, he really did always know he loved Regulus. But this time he didn't have a good answer for that either. He wished he could list everything Regulus was for him, because he missed him terribly that day and it would have been easy to talk about their love because James thought about that so much lately. More than he usually did.But he remained silent. Would he have said that Regulus was good? He was for him. For all his faults. But this is not enough. He couldn't respond with the joy of their times together, because they were often not happy, but James loved him with his imperfections. It was a feeling he couldn't explain. He couldn't find the right words, he just felt it, especially after Remus’ question, because it was dripping down his throat like honey again, dripping down past his heart, melted into his ribs.James put his hand on his chest to see if he could hold it in. The warmth, the affection he felt under his skin, deep in his bones. Just this, just like that.He couldn't. Only for a few minutes. Because Regulus was no longer there, and other than this feeling ( of which he have always been and will always be certain), everything else was fading, though the fact that he loved him was undeniable even after all this time.But Regulus' features, his smell, his voice, these James found hard to remember after a while, because he had no photographs of him, his voice was never recorded, his scent was never bottled. So James always thought of his love for Regulus, and Regulus' love for him.\"How?\" asked Remus a second time.James shook his head.\"I just knew.\"",
	"45742219000": "“嘿，扎比尼。”“……”哈利走进斯莱特林休息室，阴森森的地牢要比格兰芬多塔楼更加潮湿一些，所有家具摸上去都冰凉的像是蛇皮，他忍住心里那点不寒而栗，对着迎面而来的斯莱特林学生点头致意。他现在顶着扎比尼的脸，还好这位斯莱特林是出了名的沉默寡言，他只需要高昂头颅然后闭嘴，就能蒙过大部分学生。他今天的目的可不是跟斯莱特林的学生们聊闲天，他的目的是那位马尔福。他的老对头，最近一直表现地极为古怪。哈利想，他需要看看对方是否在寝室里窝藏了一些关于黑巫师的小玩意，至于扎比尼，还有什么是比“马尔福的室友”更有资格踏进他们寝室的呢。他又骗过另一波学生，终于拐了几个弯来到马尔福的门前，过程有点令人紧张，不过他成功来到这了。哈利松下一口气，推开房门，迎面而来的是些许水汽与淡淡的玫瑰馨香。哈利来的不是时候，德拉科刚从盥洗室出来没多久，他那顶华丽的金绿色床帐大敞着，马尔福正侧躺在床上读书。哈利心下一紧，刚想假装无事地跟对方打声招呼，再若无其事的施展几个小咒语寻找黑魔法踪迹，可只是往马尔福那里瞧了一眼，哈利就完全忘了他接下来要干什么。马尔福，那位永远把自己包裹在昂贵衣料底下的小贵族，热衷于用昂贵布料把自己包得里三层外三层像个神侍一样圣洁的漂亮小孩，现在只穿着一件长长的墨绿色真丝睡袍，左手撑着脑袋躺在床上，有一搭没一搭翻着他那本书。这种姿态实在算不得得体，事实上哈利从没见过有人是这样看书的，可那见鬼的适合一个马尔福。他看上去慵懒而迷人，沐浴后的热度和湿气从他身上散发出来，丝丝缕缕渗透进空气里。那件真丝睡袍根本就遮不住任何东西，它的唯一用途就是在卧室里增添一些狂野情趣，让贵妇们的丈夫和情人将其撕烂。藏了金线的开襟只能松松垮垮罩住马尔福半个胸脯，让另一半绯红的乳尖大大咧咧暴露在地牢的空气里。它是嫩红色的，看上去跟他的主人一般娇气，遇到冷空气就挺立起来，一边将丝绸顶出一个引人遐想的小尖，一边像奶油蛋糕顶上的糖渍樱桃一样可爱，让披着扎比尼皮的救世主盯着它饥渴地空咽了口口水。它刚被淋浴间的热水洗礼过——哈利一看就知道了，因为那些不长眼的水流在马尔福的乳肉上留下了红痕，滚烫地散发着热气，足够把哈利的眼珠灼伤。哈利深吸一口气，下令让自己转移视线。他运用了自己最坚毅的意志，终于挪动了几分，却绝望地发现马尔福像是能够预估自己眼睛的逃跑路线似的，因为他接下来看到的地方也没好到多少。他看到那邪恶睡袍的下摆处，马尔福故意伸展了一下他那双长度惊人的腿——丰腴的大腿枕在深色布料之中，白的发光，这大概是马尔福全身上下为数不多丰满的地方。它们丰满的恰到好处，刚好卡在一个微妙的临界点上，少一分便过于矜持，多一分又太过放荡。马尔福又动了一下，哈利惊恐地看着又一块布料顺着那软润的弧线滑落，那雪白的皮肉暴露在睡袍开衩之下，像过分熟透的荔枝，等不及让人来剥开它的壳就要自己先迸开，连带着里头的汁水一起流出，晶莹剔透、甜美诱人。哈利这才意识到，拥有一柜子金银首饰的马尔福从始至终都没想要炫耀过任何东西，他最珍贵的物件都被他们吝啬的、小心翼翼的藏在衣服里头。像他们这样的漂亮男孩不需要任何首饰，他们天生昂贵。哈利看傻了眼，再一次地，而马尔福也在此时也结束了他的表演，他瞥了哈利一眼，矫揉造作的放下手臂，整个人慵懒的躺在那里。“怎么了？扎比尼？”哦对，他现在是扎比尼，马尔福的室友。室友。不，他们的关系可不止是室友，哈利那些普通而纯洁的格兰芬多室友们才不会像马尔福一样穿的像个婊子。原来那些斯莱特林贵族的传言是真的，马尔福人人都骑过，是斯莱特林共用的荡妇、免费的小洞。在那些衣冠整齐的表象下、在他昂首挺胸走过教室外的长廊、在他越过长桌找自己麻烦时，屁股里可能还含着哪些斯莱特林毒蛇的精液。哈利不知道该说些什么，他的心理活动此时过于复杂了：一半的他唾弃着马尔福的放荡不堪，用恶毒的语言侮辱眼前的惑人身躯，好像这样他就能从诱惑中清醒过来；而另一半的他继续在用眼神视奸这个婊子，并且幻想着对方在床上的样子——事实上，他已经为此硬的发疼了。哈利的眼神有些凶狠，而马尔福对此极为满意。马尔福轻轻笑了一声，把那本书丢到一旁，撑起自己的身子后下了床。睡衣带子与床单摩擦了一下便松散下来，对方纤细的腰和流畅的肌肉曲线彻底暴露在外，马尔福光裸的脚底与寝室里昂贵毛毯的摩擦声沙沙作响。马尔福向他走来，哈利只能眼睁睁看着他走近，脚下就像生了根，逃不脱也不想逃。他能闻到马尔福身上的香味，这味道他经常能闻到。马尔福天天找他麻烦，乐此不疲，一靠近哈利就能闻到那股味儿，混合了橙花和青柠檬的甜味，让人下意识指间发痒。“扎比尼。”马尔福张开了嘴，舌尖在粉嫩嘴唇之中忽隐忽现。“你要是再不理我，我就去找其他人了。”而马尔福的神情分明是胜卷在握的，那双灰蓝色的湿润眼睛里满是挑衅，嘴角勾着傲慢的笑，扬起下巴张狂地暗示哈利过来吻他，仿佛这就是一件天大的赏赐一样，只要他提出，那么没有人会不想要。没有人能拒绝马尔福。哈利恍惚间想起马尔福曾说过这样一句话。他捞起马尔福的腰，粗鲁的把贵族少爷像扛麻袋一样架到肩上，对方单薄的身子倒不如他想象中的轻，想必是马尔福身上那些线条流畅的肌肉的功劳。“布雷斯！”小少爷被哈利砸进床单里——与以往的温柔不同，面前的“扎比尼”粗暴无礼，这让马尔福吓了一跳，他下意识揪住哈利肩头的布料，慌乱地用双腿夹住对方的腰。可当他与“扎比尼”对视后，那双眼睛里的火热与惊人的欲望让他的慌乱也暂停了几秒钟。“布雷斯”会把他连骨带皮地一起吞下肚。德拉科想。他有点迷茫，不知道现在他应该立刻转身就跑，还是应该去扒“布雷斯”的裤子。对方率先替他做出了决定，哈利的手绕过德拉科敞开的睡袍，精准的掐住了那块在他面前晃悠了老半天的柔软乳肉，在德拉科的痛呼中把那块小小的嫩尖扯长。“布雷斯”从来都没有这么粗鲁过，德拉科惊喘一声，疼得挺起胸膛，双手放在“布雷斯”的肩膀上推拒着，可惜无论是对于布雷斯而言，还是对于“布雷斯”而言，他的力气都太小了，比起拒绝，事实上更像是一种情趣。“好疼！”德拉科原本就没有穿着得体的睡袍前襟彻底敞开，雪白的皮肤上印着的是“布雷斯”刚掐上去的鲜红指印，红得扎眼，仿佛像是雪地里盛开的玫瑰，但比起怜惜，这样直白的视觉冲击让男人心里升起的更多的是凌虐感。“你硬了。”“布雷斯”突然说，叫还在抗拒着扭动身子的德拉科涨红着脸夹紧腿。如果说他的睡袍前襟还能勉强挂在肩上，那么他下身的开叉就只能落在身体两侧了。哈利死死盯着他裸露出来的地方——德拉科没有穿内裤，他早该知道的，这是他们这些贵族流行的另外一个淫荡的小习惯，最适合他这样放荡的婊子，光着屁股站在人群里谈笑风生也不害臊，也许只是享受屁股摩擦西服裤子的滋味就能让他一整天都是湿润的。“你喜欢疼痛？你就喜欢粗暴一点的是吗？”他几乎是低吼出了这句话，里头夹杂着他自己都说不清道不明的丑陋的嫉妒和怒火。哈利红着眼盯着德拉科，德拉科也睁大了眼睛与他对视，半晌，德拉科放在他肩膀上的双手突然放松了力道，转而乖顺地绕上他的脖颈。“你既然知道，那为什么不粗暴地操我呢？”年轻的马尔福提出了一个没有人能够拒绝的建议。沐浴后热气翻腾的水雾再一次萦绕在这间寝室里，透过木质床架的吱呀声，时不时还能听见水雾间隐藏着的微弱的哭声。“布雷斯……太深了、混、混蛋……”哈利今天才知道，马尔福这张嘴居然也会骂同学院的学生，这条坏嘴巴的小毒蛇，“你给我……额呜、轻一点！”“布雷斯”双手捏着德拉科大腿上的雪白嫩肉，有力的手指在上面按压出一排绯红指痕，丰腴的软肉溢出指缝，边缘也都沾上了粉。他一直在低头蛮干，听见这话后抬头看了一眼骂骂咧咧的小少爷，滚烫的龟头猛然抽出，连带出一大股粘稠液体洒落在床单上，咸湿的前列腺液混合小蛇自己分泌出的腥臊液体让他的洞口更加湿滑，德拉科仅仅只是扭了扭屁股就让抵在穴口的龟头滑到一边。紧接着是巴掌着肉的脆响，德拉科尖叫了一声整个腰疼得弹跳起来，被攥着胯骨箍在哈利怀里，像尾被钉住了尾巴的活鱼。德拉科看向他寡言少语的情人，那双眼睛里蕴含着的是不太清晰的怒火，那一点点情绪被蔓延上来的泪珠浸湿了，变得毫无杀伤力，颤抖的大腿根和滴水的阴茎却能从侧面反映出他对拍打似乎并没有那么排斥。哈利低声咒骂了一句，重新捞起那一双长腿，重重操了回去，挂在鸡巴上稍微干涸了一点的淫汁再次被润泽，咕叽咕叽被层层叠叠的软肉吞吃进去。而德拉科，他扶着哈利的肩膀，抖着大腿仰头完全忘了接下来要说些什么，整个贴在情人的身上只顾着浪叫，哼唧着把鼻尖蹭进哈利的肩窝。他的叫声黏糊糊的，是一罐新采的蜜糖，跟平常跋扈的模样截然相反，看来只有性爱能让他变得乖一些。他挂在哈利怀里，指甲嵌入男人结实的背肌，用屁股里的阴茎完全把他填满了，龟头碾压前列腺，榨出一股又一股汁液，顺着抽插时打开的缝隙全喷在对方的裤子上。“你的水太多了，把我的裤子都给弄脏了。”哈利用手摸了一下他们的结合处，沾上了一指尖汁液，全被他抹到德拉科脸上。后者哼哼一声，偏头一口咬在他指腹上。“谁叫你要穿着衣服操我。”没想到马尔福喜欢亲密接触，他一直以为贵族少爷在床上都有点奇怪的小洁癖，会在床上有一大堆规矩。德拉科的腿弯夹着他的腰，小腿悬在空中随着他们的动作摇晃，小腹被他顶在里头的东西撑到微微痉挛。德拉科躺在湿漉漉的睡袍上，这件织品终于没法再半遮半掩得诱惑人了，晕湿的布料不能再在烛火的照耀下反射出漂亮的光泽了，它变得皱皱巴巴，漆黑成一团被压在他们身下。“太深了、太深了……”德拉科无意识般呓语，浅粉色的嘴唇之间探出一小截艳色舌尖，这小混球连一张嘴都能长得漂亮，可惜它从说不出什么漂亮话。“你要……你要弄坏我了……”那双灰蓝色的眼眶终于落下泪，被哈利活生生操出来的，马尔福在他面前哭过好多次，但这一次的确是新奇体验。哈利以为他还在愣神，视线中出现的分明还是马尔福的脸，可当他意识到周围似乎有些过分安静，脸颊边又有些温热的时候，哈利才意识到他早就低下头去，他的身体先行于他的大脑，面对着一个哭泣着颤抖的马尔福，选择了亲吻。“……德拉科。”他说。“我没想过要吻你……抱歉？”他身下的小少爷涨红了脸颊，耳尖更是能红得滴血，他看上去甚至有点可爱，但哈利有点高兴不起来。“好吧，布雷斯，闭嘴，你什么时候变得这么懂礼貌了。”德拉科扭着腰蹭上来，张嘴咬在哈利下巴上。哈利能听见他口齿间含含糊糊的声音，傲慢却令人意外的甜蜜。如果他叫的是我的名字那就更好了，哈利突然想到。“你这么喜欢我也无可厚非，毕竟没人能拒绝一个马尔福。”德拉科天真地晃着脚，视线的死角让他完全看不到“布雷斯”额头上渐渐浮现的疤痕。“还愣着干什么？我允许你今天多亲两口，快继续。”好吧，没人能拒绝一个马尔福。哈利呼出一口气。 end",
	"45742216000": "“I can’t believe we’re doing this” said Remus“I can’t believe you’re doing this”, Sirius replied. “Are you ready?”“I am”Sirius covered Remus and himself with James’ invisibility cloak which he stole from James while he was sleeping 15 minutes before that.“Quiet now, I don’t want you to get in trouble, Remus”“Shhh. Let’s just get this over with. I’m thirsty”The two sneaked into the Three Broomsticks and into the storage area behind the counter. Stacked in front of them was several big barrels labeled “Alcoholic Butterbeer” and “Non Alcoholic Butterbeer”“There it is. Alcoholic Butterbeer, I’ve been wanting to try this forever. Remus, please tell me you have that chalice”Remus pulled out a small chalice from his right pocket. The chalice is enchanted to hold an infinite amount of whatever liquid is put into it.“Right here”“Good. Now, how do we do this without making too much noise”“Maybe we could just poke a small hole in the barrel”“Not a bad idea, but that would take all night. Have you any other ideas?”“None that wouldn’t involve drawing attention to ourselves”“Fine. We’ll do the hole idea”The two boys looked around the room to see if they could see anything to put a hole in one of the barrels. There was nothing.“I have an idea, Sirius”“Good. What is it?”“Transfigure into a dog and bite a hole in the barrel”“Remus, you’re a fucking genius”Sirius transfigured into his dog form and sunk his teeth into the bottom of the barrel. Butterbeer started spilling everywhere. Remus quickly put the chalice under one of the spillage areas and kept it there until the barrel emptied while Sirius kept a lookout.It took about 30 minutes before the barrel was completely empty. Remus covered the chalice with a spill proof cap and put it back into his pocket.“Sirius, what are we going to do about this mess?”There was more Butterbeer on the floor than in the chalice“Nothing. Let’s get out of here”The two covered themselves in the invisibility cloak again and snuck out of the Three Broomsticks and made their way to the Shrieking Shack. They sat beside each other on an old couch.“I think I should try it first. In case it’s poisoned. You understand, don’t you Remus?”“Very funny”Remus handed Sirius the chalice. Sirius removed the cap and took a sip“MERLIN’S ASS. That’s different”“Different? How so?”“It’s more….it’s bitter. Here, try some for yourself”Remus took a sip and started coughing“My throat feels like it’s on fire”“You’re such a pussy, Remus. It’s not that bad”The two took turns drinking from the chalice. An hour later…“R-Rem-Remus. You are….drrrrrunk”“I’m n-not drunk…yo-you’re drunk”“Nahhhhhh”“Yeahhhhh”They both started laughing“Remus, i-if you’re not drunk the-then walk o-over to that w-wall and back without f-falling over”“E-easy”Remus stood up from the couch and fell back onto it and started laughing“You c-can’t even s-stand up you’re so d-drunk”“You do it then, Sirius”“Fine”Sirius stood up and walked a few steps“S-see I am not drunk Remus. Y-you’re just a light-a lightweight”Sirius lost balance and fell to the ground. The two laughed hysterically“Okay, m-maybe I am drunk”Sirius crawled back onto the couch and sat beside Remus again, resting his head on his shoulder“Remus?”“Mhm”“What girl in school do you like?”“Why?”“Because you never talk about that stuff with me and I’m curious”“I don’t like any girls”“Same”“No way”“I swear”“Do you like any boys?”“Maybe”“Who?”“The boy sitting beside me”“Be Sirius”Remus started laughing“You’re so cringey. And I am being serious”“That’s weird”“What’s weird about it?”“Because I like you too”“No way”“I do. I’m being Sirius”“Shut up, Remus”“I’m so funny sometimes”“You’ll never be as funny as me”“I’ve always been funnier than you”“No you have not”I have”“If I agree with you will you shut up”“Maybe”“You’ve always been funnier than me, Remus”“I know”“So what now?”“I don’t know”“Should we kiss?”“That would be nice”Sirius elevated his head to kiss Remus. The two locked lips and kissed for ages until they fell asleep.",
	"45742156000": "Salt water shoved into his mouth in handfuls and blinded him. He guessed this is what death must look like, like the depths of the ocean with the human soul floating freely in the gentle waves.Perhaps it wasn't specifically death, but rather a thin line between death and life. But not the one that stretches when a man exhales his last breath, but the one that separates him from breathing again.Was he about to be born soon?The water gently caressed his skin, and the wet places went numb as it evaporated. The sun was merciless today. Remus felt like he had experienced something similar before. There was something familiar about the vastness of the waters around him.Remus… Yes, it must have been his new name, but also familiar. It was as if he already knew the story that was yet to unfold. He narrowed his eyes, tired from the light, and surrendered himself completely to the moments that were to follow.In a split second, everything suddenly changed. First his fingertips touched the rough, grainy bottom, and his eyelids shot up again. The white of the sky, to which he was so accustomed, began to scatter in unruly puffs, from which azure blue emerged.Only then did he become aware of the pain that shot through his entire body. His skin was taut, his eyes were twitching, and shallow breaths were barely entering his lungs. He didn't realize that birth could be as painful as death.The next thing that took hold of his thinking was a loud pounding in his ears, like a stormy sea, which until recently had been surrounded by stern silence. Amidst the pounding, he heard an uneven rumble of sounds.He was slowly regaining control of his body. First, the entire torso was rotated by the waves. Then his muscular but limp and weak arms lifted his weight, trembling and sinking into the sand. Soon their bent knees joined them. Only in this position did Remus fully emerge from the water and was immediately shaken by a sharp cough.His gaze, fixed on the glassy water, lifted hesitantly to the rocky shore covered with sparse yellow-green grass. However, it wasn't the sight that caught his attention, but the big black dog that was standing nearby.If the animal bared its fangs, Remus would have been afraid that he was dealing not with an ordinary creature, but with a beast that had come to take away his last strength, but the dog looked at him gently, and the long, hairy tail wagged from side to side in a joyful gesture.Now Remus realized what the loud sounds were, breaking through the pounding in his ears. The dog was barking.Suddenly, Remus was overcome with a terrible emotion. It seemed to him that he had not seen a living creature for millennia. In addition, the kindness in the dog's eyes gave him a strange feeling of nostalgia. Everything was so familiar.His body trembled as he got on all fours to the animal, which stared at him fearlessly. Finally, his hands clasped around his black, thick neck, and a stream of tears flowed from his eyes that seemed to have no end.If the gods had been any kinder, they would have let him last forever with his head buried in the dog's soft chest. They would have allowed that closeness that soothed his tattered heart. However, after a while the dog broke free of his grip and walked away from the shore towards the well-trodden path.Remus, though not fully awake, was aware of the dangers that might await him on an unfamiliar land. Strange peoples and inhuman customs. The uncertain path could lead him to torture. This, though frightening, dispersed completely when the dog stopped and stared at him again, as if hoping for more company.Rising from the harsh ground was hard and paid with severe pain that intensified with each step. But Remus followed the dog over the hot sand that burned his feet, the great boulders and the rough, dry grass, and then the brown path, which was suddenly surrounded by thick green trees, bringing coolness and comfort.Remus breathed deeper and deeper, and the pleasant smell of soil and bark filled his nostrils. The soft song of rustling leaves and birdsong would have calmed him completely if not for the announcement of the unknown that awaited him at the end of the path.The dog stopped in the middle of the grove. There was no settlement around, not a single hut, or any other trace of human presence. Remus felt a huge relief, and the tension that drained from his body was replaced by great tiredness. He looked around, finding in the shade of the trees a circle of rough-hewn boulders that looked more like the work of God than the work of human hands. Remus sat down on one of the boulders, studying the dog carefully.The dog took a few steps back, suddenly intimidated, but his intimidation was not even a substitute for what Remus felt when the dog suddenly transformed into a young man.His pearly skin shimmered in the rays of the sun breaking through the treetops, and his dark hair cascaded over his graceful shoulders like mountain streams. He stood completely naked, but with the grace of a nymph and the certainty of a god. Remus knew he wasn't dealing with a human, but he couldn't tell the rank of the creature before him.He was intimidated by its beauty. His breathing became shallow again and sped up so much that the man was sure he was going to pass out soon. The aura of the character that graced him with its presence could cause nations to bow at his nod, and people to lose their minds just staring at his person.\"You're injured.\" The words, spoken softly, echoed through the grove and probably had made their way to the top of the nearby mountains before Remus realized the man had spoken them to him.“Yes.”His hoarse voice suddenly sounded ugly and shameful to him, but the man remained impassive before him. He stared at him with an enigmatic gaze, only to close the distance between them after a moment.The man raised his hand and gently touched his forehead. The touch left a faint red mark on his pale fingertips, which also covered his faded cheeks. So Remus couldn't be mortally wounded, though his breath froze.“You must be tired. Lie down.” He pointed to the green, fluffy grass growing between the branches of the trees.Remus obeyed the order without hesitation, and the next one - he was to wait. The man turned into a dog again and disappeared for a long time. All he could do was stare blankly at the green leaves, which, however, did not reach his eyes. Beneath the eyelids, instead of sketches of reality, there was a beautiful, boyish face, the pale shade of which had turned scarlet so wonderfully.Remus didn't know the nature of inhuman beings, but the reaction sent a wave of heat through him that he couldn't shake off. So he thought constantly. He thought of full, rosy lips, a straight nose, and flawless skin. It brought back endless memories of glass eyes, the colour of which was like dark clouds shrouding the sky, obscuring something that was hidden somewhere deeper. Until finally he began to imagine. He speculated on how soft the stranger's skin might be under the pressure of Remus' fingers, what sounds might leave his rosy lips, and whether they would taste like intoxicating honey.The man returned, in human form again, with a piece of white cloth and a small bowl in his hands. He knelt down and gently placed Remus' head on his lap, to which he applied a cloth that smelled of acrid mountain herbs. This one immediately stuck to his dry skin.For Remus, this event was similar to a wonderful dream, where an almost divine being cares for the wounds of a brave hero. But he wasn't a hero. He certainly wasn't anyone important, at least not enough to remember his past.The thought clouded his feelings. It was not a birth, though these events proved to be a new beginning indeed, with a baby-like absence of the past.“Eat.”A warm voice snapped him out of his thoughts, and the stranger's worried gaze filled him with guilt. The man helped him sit up, then put the end of the clay bowl to his chapped lips, where Remus soon tasted the salutary brew. The sweetness of vegetables and juices rendered from the meat filled its interior, which until then had remained crushingly empty.“This will help you regain your strength...”Remus drank the potion down, though his oesophagus tightened with redoubled force, almost sending him into a fit of coughing and violent vomiting.\"They call me Remus,\" he said just after finishing his meal. He didn't trust the man completely, but the man took care of him with such care. So an introduction was necessary.\"Who calls you that?\" the man asked, staring at him with crystal eyes that made Remus feel that it wasn't the stranger, but he was sitting completely naked.“I don't know.” He answered honestly. He wasn't so much afraid of telling a lie as he felt that with just a little honesty he would be able to repay the debt of gratitude to a strange man, which was growing more and more with each passing moment. Despite the answer, no further question was asked.“Sirius.” The man pronounced his name accurately, pointing a slender finger at his own chest carved as if in marble, and the gaze he gave Remus was piercing. He lost his strength, however, as silence filled the place of the earlier conversation. “You do not know me.” The last sentence was not accompanied by bitterness, but surprise.“I regret that too.”The words left his lips before he could stop them. Sirius' presence made him feel like he was losing control of his thoughts. Perhaps he had powers that Remus was unaware of, or perhaps his beauty had deceived the young man too much.Remus expected indignation or anger, but certainly not what happened in that moment.Sirius leaned in nimbly and brushed his lips gently over his chapped lips. It didn't even last a second, but Remus would have given an eternity to go back to that moment again.\"You don't know me, but I know you,\" Sirius announced suddenly.“How is it...?”Remus pulled back slightly, only to look into those cloud-covered eyes, as if he wanted to see the truth behind the curtain for himself.“I saw you from the sky.”“Then you are a god.”A ringing laugh echoed through the grove, echoed to the edge of the mountains. Oh how wonderful he was. So sincere, so sweet to the ear. Remus' mouth twitched involuntarily.“Why. I'm not a god.”“Who are you then?”Remus stared at him curiously, but couldn't read his body language. Every gesture and every word came suddenly.“Wouldn't you rather find out who you are?”“No.” he replied without hesitation. His past had no meaning in the face of the present he was given to experience.And again this crimson covered the smiling face of Sirius with a beauty unknown even to the most eminent poets and painters. With a beauty that cannot be contained in human reasoning.He stared at Remus for a brief moment, as if assessing whether he could trust him.“I am a star” his gaze wandered to the ground. “I was immortalized in the heavenly vault to stay there forever.”Sirius grimaced, depression arching his back slightly. Had he been human, he might have wept bitterly at this moment, but he only looked down absently.\"And yet you are here,\" Remus remarked quietly.“This punishment broke my heart. I was unable to reconcile myself to the thought that my foot would never set foot on my native land again, that my lungs would not be filled with a warm breath. The groans of my despair reached Olympus itself. I was allowed to fall to Earth, but on a deserted island where I will not be able to harm anyone.”There was silence, not broken even by the rustling of the trees. Everything froze, listening to the sour words of the young man who looked up at his interlocutor.“Are you afraid of me?”“No.” Remus replied the same way for the second time. \"But if you'll let me, I'd like to understand...”Sirius nodded slightly.\"I've never been free,\" he began bitterly. “I don't know whose son I was. I did not know what I was, and my body was like two beings. And my master was a soulless monster whose deeds spilled over the Earth in a wave of misery.”The man wrapped his strong arms around his body and trembled, although the sun, at its zenith, hell doubled its strength.“Orion, for that was my master's name, was a giant of great strength, but heartless. Once he had a beautiful wife, more beautiful than Hera, but it brought her doom and she was thrown into Tartarus. Orion had been harassing women before losing his wife, but after that his violence increased greatly. It even made him blind, though the gods allowed him to regain it. He often got angry… And I obeyed his orders, like an ordinary filthy mongrel.”\"It wasn't your fault,\" Remus tried to whisper some comfort, though he knew the meaning of his words was slightly off the mark.\"Oh, I wasn't blameless,\" Sirius shook his head with a bitter smile. \"I've enjoyed everything about the giant's company. Security, riches, women, I took a handful of it.”\"I understand the meaning of my punishment,\" Sirius said after a moment of silence that fell between them. \"I'm not even sure that joining the ranks of the stars was really a punishment. Probably it was just getting rid of an element that violated the order in the world ... However, I can't change anything any more. He is there too, turned into a luminous constellation, and I will have to be by his side to the end of my days.”“Couldn't you change your fate?”\"Remus, no one can escape fate,\" the man replied plaintively.“And yet you are here.”A cloudy gaze shot his way, and Remus could have sworn he saw a flash of bright light among the clouds. The sight made his whole body go limp instantly, but he couldn't stop it.They stared at each other for a while, but then Sirius's voice snapped them out of their reverie again, a bit more squeaky than before.\"Perhaps my return was part of my destiny...”\"Perhaps,\" Remus nodded. “You don't know what fate will bring you.”The features of the pearly face softened, and Sirius suddenly looked a little younger than before.\"Perhaps,\" he continued, \"perhaps you will return to Earth to start your life anew. People - and not people” he put in quickly “make mistakes. That's how it is.”They both nodded silently.\"You were supposed to be king, you know\" Sirius said suddenly. “You were not much older than your brother, just minutes apart.”\"Sirius... I don't know if I want to know my past,\" Remus replied anxiously, trying to fight the growing lump in his throat. He didn't want to know who he was before he came to this island. He preferred his first memory to be of the fabulous seashore and the stunning beauty of Sirius.Sirius looked at him seriously.“You're not without fault, and yet you got a second chance.”“I see.”“Despite your right for the throne, the gods helped your brother.”“Stop…”“And you in anger crossed the border of his city.”“Sirius-”\"He didn't mean to kill you, but he faked your death, so you could-\"“Enough!”The scream echoed off into the unknown. Hot tears ran down Remus' cheeks, staining his eyelids red.“I remember... But I don't want to.”\"You should,\" Sirius looked at him determinedly. “You should remember this quarrel. You have to know your escape and the hardship of crossing the sea.”“I don’t want to.”Remus hid his face in his hands, and a pitiful sob escaped his mouth, causing his body to tremble. Cold sweat covered his skin, and he tasted the burning taste of bile in his dilatation.He did not want to attack his brother's city, but anger clouded his reasoning. After the victorious ritual, Romulus changed, was unavailable and looked at his brother with eloquent superiority. Remus had been banished from his heart, and that was a hundred times worse than being banished from the city. And he just wanted to restore the way things were...“Your brother has not given up his love for you.”The meaning of Sirius's words took a moment to sink in, but he couldn't bear it.“He didn't kill you because he still loved you.”\"I'm a monster, Sirius,\" Remus shook his head. “My anger and violence are the same as your master’s. I shouldn't live among humans.”\"Your anger is nothing in the face of your sweet heart, Remus.\"Only after these words did Remus remove his fingers from his puffy eyes and glance uncertainly at Sirius.“You said yourself that people make mistakes. Both you and your brother did it. If you believe your own words, remember your past and believe in redemption... Believe them because I believed them.”The twinkle in Sirius' eyes would have made his knees buckle if they hadn't been sitting up. He wishes he could believe it. He wanted them, despite their mistakes, to find themselves in a new beginning. He wishes he could start over.“If we started over... How would you like to live?”Sirius took a deep breath and his gaze went to the blue sky.\"I think I'd like to be with someone who would accept me. I lived among beings, but I was not allowed to attach myself. I was not of men, nor of gods, nor of any beings and beasts that I knew. I have not known my place on earth.”Remus nodded understandingly. He had the impression that Sirius' desire hung somewhere in the air above their heads, clouding his thoughts. Desire for intimacy, love, friendship and family.“I might become a warrior. Of course, if I had something to protect.”Fleshy lips stretched into a wide smile, revealing a series of snow-white teeth. Remus' heart beat dangerously.\"I think if I had someone close to my heart, I would teach them to defend themselves in case I was missing,\" Remus said, thinking deeply. “Though I don't want any more wars and conflicts.”“Me neither…”They listened to the sounds of nature, although their thoughts were far in the future, which perhaps would never exist.Remus' gaze roamed the brown branches until he rested on the bright silhouette of his companion, the brightest star. Then Remus realized that all he needed was a warm heart that would beat to his same rhythm.Perhaps both are waiting for the redemption that has already arrived. Maybe their punishment was over and they could start anew with each other by their side. Oh, if only he could live like this forever. If he could bathe in the sea in the warm mornings and pick juicy fruits from green trees, and in the evenings...His breathing quickened nervously, and his eyes tore sharply from the puffy mouth that was so tempting.“You want it?”Sirius approached him but stopped as their faces almost met. Remus felt his warm breath on his cheeks.He was unable to answer as his throat tightened with emotion and his lips twitched dangerously. So he crossed the space they shared and connected their lips clumsily. Sirius immediately threaded his slender hands into his curls, not allowing him to back away. But Remus refused to back down. He deepened the kiss, running his fingers gently over the alabaster jaw. Their bodies quivered with the immense excitement that flared up in Remus' belly, tensing every tendon and every muscle in anticipation.As soon as he heard a quiet sigh from Sirius' mouth, he overbalanced him with his body and pinned him to the hard ground. He tore off the tattered fabric that had once been his robe and stood back for a moment to take in the sight of the beautiful body. Black curls spread out on the sides of her head, shining like a halo, her hands trembled, and a bloody blush covered her solid chest and face. Sirius' eyes darkened with boundless desire, and saliva gathered at the corners of his slightly parted mouth.Remus slid his gaze down, down the sculpted torso, to the thin line of black hair that led to a place of pleasure that was red with impatience. He placed a gentle kiss on his hot breast and covered his naked body with more, lower and lower, to finally take it in his mouth. Sirius arched his back and his moan echoed around the area.Soon, however, Remus returned his mouth to his and slowly drowned his body in its warmth. They moved slowly, without haste and without unnecessary words, only to the accompaniment of their soft moans and sighs. Sirius hugged him tightly, and Remus nuzzled his head tenderly into the crook of his neck every now and then. The tension between them grew stronger with every second, until it finally spilled out of them in a wave of fulfilment.They breathed deeply into each other.\"Your skin is so warm,\" Remus sighed softly, pressing his temple against it.“Can we stay longer like that?”And they stayed there, listening to the last chirp of the birds as the sky turned crimson of the setting sun.\"There's so much I want to show you, Remus,\" Sirius finally spoke, but his words sounded hopelessly sad. “Not only the rest of the island, its beautiful streams, mountain flowers and young chamois. I'd like to show you all the stars I know. The beautiful Pleiades, for example. You'd like them.”\"I can stay.\" Remus propped himself up on one elbow and looked at Sirius with a smile. \"I'd like to stay if you'll let me. We could see so many things, so much to discover” Remus' smile became brighter with each word. “There is still so much ahead of us! We could even leave the island and go into the unknown. We could-”\"We can't,\" Sirius cut him off suddenly, avoiding his gaze.\"We don't have to leave the island,\" Remus replied nervously, his smile fading.\"Remus, when the sky is filled with stars again, I will have to leave. It was my last day.”His voice trembled and his eyes glistened in the last rays of the sun. Remus felt all the last of his strength leave his body.\"No… No, Sirius, no, that's… no.\"He shook his head, mentally searching for a solution, even though he knew that what lay ahead was inevitable. Sirius' fate was sealed, the gods had decreed it, and no one and nothing could change that.“Sorry.”“Why didn't you say anything?” Remus asked, not out of outcasting, but with bitterness squeezing his heart.\"If I said… I didn't want to think about it, Remus.\"He nodded understandingly. The thought of parting poisoned his soul with unimaginable despair.He looked towards the sun, only the tip of which protruded inconspicuously above the surface of the vast sea. They only had a moment to say goodbye forever.Before Remus could turn around, Sirius had wrapped his arms around his neck and brought their bodies together. His sobs echoed dully against Remus' ears as he stared blankly ahead. No, it certainly wasn't redemption. It was the worst of all punishments. He just had a bit of luck and already…\"You'll be back here again,\" Remus whispered softly, stroking his lover's hair gently.“Remus…”\"Shh, we'll meet again sometime. I promise. I will wait for you as long as it takes. Sirius, I love you.”The crying became even hotter, and warm lips brushed the side of his head fiercely.“I will come back to you.”Before the words of promise broke through the chains of his mind, all the warm touch was gone, and his hands clenched dully in the air. Sirius left. … Years passed, and Remus still stood patiently on the island. Every day he went to fetch water from swift streams, looked after mountain goats, which after some time he tamed, and from time to time he caught fish in clear sea waters. At night, he would take a handful of flowers gathered in the mountains and go to the seashore, where he would lie down on the soft sand and look emotionally at the sky. Sometimes he had the impression that the brightest of all stars was winking merrily at him, though he couldn't be sure, because hot tears blurred his vision every time. So he lay there and talked. He talked about his experiences and thoughts, about the song he wrote himself, or about not to worry, because he is still waiting.Eventually he grew old, but he welcomed old age with more joy than his youth. For each year he made sure in his mind that they would meet again. Perhaps it is not life that will bring them together, but death. Maybe both of their souls will meet among the stars and look down on the world together. Remus prepared a pair of blue flowers, which he managed to collect with difficulty. Lately he can't bend down, and his hands ache from just pressing against the soft stalk. But he folded them with painstaking accuracy into a modest bouquet and toddled slowly to the seashore.Despite the cool air drenched in sea salt, his breathing was getting worse. It took him a long time to just lie down on the sand, but he finally looked at him. No sight defect could dim its bright light.Remus blinked rapidly, feeling the tears on his eyelashes.\"It's for you,\" he whispered, clutching the bouquet to his chest. \"They may not be the grandest, but that doesn't matter, because we'll meet again soon, right?\" His lips, though trembling, lifted into a tender smile. “I love you so much.”Remus closed his eyes, feeling the last warm breath leave his body and travel upwards to the stars.",
	"45741868000": "“Did you take me here just to have someone to cry to?” I was standing in front of Oliver Wood, the captain of the Gryffindor team. He had called for an emergency meeting regarding tomorrow's game.\n“I just wanted to remind you to teach your team about fair play.”\n“Are you suggesting that we cheat?”\n“All I know is that at least one of my players always ends up in the hospital wing after we play you.” He took a step closer to intimidate me.\n“Watch your tongue or I will personally make sure that you’re the one who ends up there,” I hissed at him, poking him in the chest.\nI realised how close we’d gotten and tried to back away only to hit the lockers one millimetre behind me. We locked eyes, breathing heavily. I looked to his lips, seeing his tongue wet them. With a sharp intake of breath we closed the distance between us. My hands found their way to his hair, it was short but oh so soft. He was the one to break the kiss.\n“Is that supposed to sound like a threat?”\nI shut him up by pulling him down by the neck, once again connecting our lips with a kiss. This time it was heated. Our mouths moved in sync. One of his hands held my face while the other rested on my waist. He pressed me harder against the doors letting me know of the growing hardness in his trousers. I moaned into his mouth at the feeling. He broke apart once again just to give me a smirk. With a plain face I grabbed the bulge firmly. He let out a needy moan which I replied to with the same evil smirk.\nI turned us around so that his back was against the wall. My thumbs snarked its ways beneath the waistband of his trousers. I leaned up to his ear and whispered,\n“Is this okay?”\n“Yes,” he whispered back, covering my hands with his own. While kissing his neck, earning pretty whines, I slowly buttoned up his pants. I didn’t touch him where he needed it the most, instead my hands travelled up under his shirt feeling every muscle. The cold skin felt so good heating up against my bare arms, I wrapped my hands around his back, pressed myself against him to relish every inch of him that I could reach. The scrunched up shirt I slowly guided over his head, throwing it on the floor. The constant practice of quidditch was evident in his muscles. I let my hands slide down the length of his arms, knitting our fingers together at the end.\nEventually, one of my hands reached beneath his underwear, fingers wrapped around the thick length of Wood. Audibly he gasped, letting the air out with shaky breaths. I chuckled.\n“We’ll see who laughs tomorrow after I’ve won,” Wood remarked, tilting his head back with pleasure.\n“If I can make you fall apart like this now, just you wait until we’re on the pitch,” I breathed. “Look at the state of you, I’ve barely even touched you yet.”\nHe covered his mouth as he moaned as to stop the sounds. I smirked.\n“Do you like it when I do that?” taunted I. “When I tell you how pathetic you are?”\nAnother moan. I started to move my hands along his cock in slow motions.\n“Of course you do,” I chuckled at the revelation. I let go of his shaft. A whine comes from above me, longing for my touch. I locked eyes with Wood as I brought my tongue over my palm. His stare was intense though his eyelids hid parts of the iris. Even worse, his hand covered the rest of his face. “Now, now, don’t keep your pretty sounds away from me.”\nHe reluctantly took away his hand. At that I took a hold on his dick again, continuing my motions, spit working as a lubricant.\n“Good boy,” I praised.\n“Fuck off,” he muttered.\n“Should I?” I stopped moving my hand, resting my thumb on his slit with a loose grip on the rest of him.\n“No,” he decided, bringing me into a kiss by the collar of my shirt. “Fuck no.”\nA smile spread on my face. He hungrily bit my lips gently only to attack them with his again. I could feel myself getting more needy for every passing minute. My hand gliding up and down along Wood’s dick, his breathy moans filling the room as we devoured each other entirely.\nHis mouth left my lips, trailing along my face until he reached my neck.\n“Wood,” I moaned his name, yearning for more.\n“Call me Oliver,” he quietly begged against my neck.\n“Oliver,” I whispered as if to try it, then with more force I moaned in pleasure, “Oliver.”\nThat seemed to do it. As I brung my hand over his dick faster and faster he let out a final groan as he finished. Mouth formed into an ‘o’ shape, eyes rolled back. He gripped my arm tightly while riding out his high.\nHe rested against the lockers, breathing heavily as if he had not filled his lungs with air properly in a while. His cum covered my fingers and our torsos. While waiting for him to come back to a normal breathing I smeared his cum onto his stomach, drawing little hearts that gleamed in the light.\nA rather large hand found its way into my hair. I reached for the wand in my pocket, waving it and muttering a spell to get his mess off of us. The shirt I had previously thrown was handed back to its owner. He just held it.\n“You don’t want me to take care of you as well?” he asked. I was worried that my friends were wondering what was taking so long and would walk in any moment.\n“No, maybe tomorrow after I’ve won, you can give it to me as a present.” I winked. He smiled at me.\n“I won’t be able to if you ‘personally make sure that I’m the one who ends up in the hospital wing’,” he mocked my words. I just returned his smile with a smirk.\n“Oh you’ll find a way.” I opened the door and looked back. He was still standing in the same spot, trousers zipped up but shirt still off. “Later, Oliver.”",
	"45741376000": "I can't save us, my Atlantis, we fall We built this town on shaky ground I can't save us, my Atlantis, oh, no We built it up to pull it down\n⠀\n\ni. \n \nHermione loves sea salt yet her mouth is full of metallic, blood-bitter chlorine.For some reason, Hermione always puts too much salt into every other dish for their weekly Saturday dinners with Narcissa. She tastes the sauce/spaghetti/chicken and curses under her breath, meeting the familiar pale-blue eyes of an amused Draco. “And who have you fallen in love with yet again, my darling?” Her husband teases oh so softly, pulling Hermione away from the stove and into his waiting embrace. He leaves a habitual kind of kiss in the corner of her mouth, and Hermione feels like her lungs are overflowing with a bitter, metallic taste of chlorine. On the inside, she longs for the salt-infused air and lukewarm sand on a deserted beach as the sun sets; yet on the outside, she is firmly rooted to the ground akin to a trunk of a decaying tree, and her eyes are focused right over Draco’s shoulder with laser-like precision, unable to look away from Narcissa’s starved-for-affection face, drained of all color. Narcissa sits at the kitchen table and watches them oh so attentively, with a porcelain doll smile plastered across her too-pale face. In these moments, she seems so fragile, as if a single push in the wrong direction could break her, make her fall apart. And Hermione knows that Narcissa is falling apart on a weekly basis like clockwork—every Saturday, when she sees the two of them together.Hermione falls apart along with her, because she had the misfortune to fall in love with nobody but Narcissa.\n\n⠀\n\n\nii.\n \nHermione loves her so much that she's ready to scream off the top of her lungs from a too-tall skyscraper in Muggle London, dressed in see-through glass akin to the subtlety of their feelings for one another. And so when one night, Narcissa is suddenly doubting everything—them, the inappropriateness of it all, the eternity they’ve condemned each other to—Hermione grabs her by her too-thin wrist and apparates them to a skyscraper made of glass in the middle of Muggle London.They land on the rooftop, and Narcissa stumbles, her body colliding with Hermione’s as if she’s the only thing that can keep her standing. The wind is terribly strong, swooshing around them in gusts and bursts that make Hermione want to hold Narcissa impossibly tighter. The month of November is unusually cold even for gloomy England; the bone-chilling air slips under the sleeves of Hermione's thick woolen sweater like sand. Yet Hermione takes off her sweater, leaving only a thin long sleeve underneath, and gives the ball of maroon-colored wool concoction to Narcissa. All her warmth, everything she owns and everything she never will—all of it she is ready to give to Narcissa without a second thought. It’s as if her barely beating heart is laid out on the palm of her too-pale trembling hand, and when she hands it to Narcissa with death-like finality, she is ready to subject herself to the cruel twists of fate; yet, secretly, under layers and layers of heavy makeup and endless inches of yellowed parchment, she hopes that Narcissa will choose to bring Hermione back to life every time she is offered the chance to end it.Narcissa chooses Hermione, always; she grabs the sweater the color of her favorite burgundy with a smile softer than velvet and pulls it over her head in a too-familiar motion. They stand on the roof of a glass-covered skyscraper for hours, basking in the night clouds above them and the tentative knowledge that this is the one place where they cannot be seen. ⠀\n\n⠀\n\n\niii.\n \nHermione and Draco go swimming together every day at eight in the morning, accompanied by teasing text messages from Pansy about being insufferable lovebirds even after almost a decade of marriage. They swim for an hour or two on neighboring lanes, and each time before they part to head to the locker rooms after completing their morning session, Draco kisses her. It tastes like the metallic sting of chlorine, like blood seeping out from the inside of her cheek she can’t stop biting down, and Hermione fights the urge to pull away.When Hermione is with Narcissa, their kisses taste of sea salt. Because Narcissa cries every single time their lips collide, and the devilish mix of guilt and love splashes in her eyes the color of sea surface, threatening to spill over. Narcissa is always soft, pliant, melting under her touch.“This is wrong,” she whispers as Hermione gently runs her fingertips over Narcissa’s bitten-down lips. The tears are streaming down her too-pale cheeks, for she knows that, despite the wrongness of it all, her heart keeps screaming at her that this is right, that they are meant to be, that there will always be a  them .Won’t there? \n\n⠀\n\n\niv.\n\n⠀\n\nThe universe has a different plan. There won’t be a  them  anymore. There was them, once, in the past; the past that Narcissa will never be able to share with a single soul. Because being together becomes a little too dangerous—one day, when Hermione is out of town on a work trip, Draco calls Narcissa and shares his concerns, convinced that Hermione is having an affair, that she betrayed him, has been betraying them for the past couple of months.  Nine months,  Narcissa thinks to herself and realizes that it’s not Hermione who is betraying Draco—it’s Narcissa herself. Selfishly, she keeps choosing love over her son, all because fate willed her to fall for the most unattainable woman on the planet Earth—her own daughter-in-law.Narcissa wants to kiss Hermione to the point of no return, even though it is already there, and there is no going forward for them. She wants to grab the suitcases full of knick-knacks, books, and clothes that smell like them and escape to a forever far-away land—somewhere where Draco will never find them. Yet, instinctively, Narcissa knows that she will leave a trail of suffocating guilt and betrayal in her wake; that she will break somewhere along the way and drop the remains of her shattered heart like breadcrumbs. It will be almost too easy to find her. “If we lived on the moon, we would’ve been together,” Narcissa whispers, tucking a strand of hair behind Hermione’s ears. Her hands shake as much as whenever Hermione offers up her heart to Narcissa, and Narcissa knows, instinctively, that in this flicker of a moment, she is stealing it for the rest of eternity. Burning-hot tears are streaming down Hermione’s cheeks, swiftly prompted by the softness of a gesture and the cruelty of words. Akin to breadcrumbs, the torn-apart pieces of her heart fall onto the rooftop of a glass-coated skyscraper in the middle of Muggle London, yet Hermione knows that she won’t be able to find her way back home, not after this. Narcissa knows it, too, and if her heart breaks along with Hermione’s, it’s because they’ve been sharing the same heart for years. “I don't want the moon. I want  here , with you.”“Hermione—”“I will leave him, Cissa,” Hermione blurts out, the fateful-fatal words that will change everything, and nothing at all. “Today, right now. Just say a word, and I'm yours.”The stretch of silence chills Hermione to the bone even more than the December wind on top of a forty-floor skyscraper. “He's my son, Hermione.” Narcissa is burning the words into her own sternum, pushing them out with all the force she can muster. “There could never be another ending for the story of us.” The words fall in the tiny space between them in a heavy block of ice; not even the warmth of Hermione’s gaze will be able to melt it, no matter how hard she tries. ⠀\n\n⠀\n\n\nv. \n \nThere isn’t a  them  anymore. There is no more Hermione Granger-Malfoy, either.Instead, there is Narcissa, whose son grieves the loss of his wife, and Narcissa, who mourns the loss of her world.She never looks at skyscrapers the same way again. In her mind, there is forever an image ingrained of a free fall she was never able to stop.",
	"45741217000": "PROLOGUE\n\nShe wasn't doing so well inside. Her heart had been pounding at an outrageous rate for two days now, until she was panicking that she was going to suffer some kind of heart attack.\nHer palms were constantly sweating, and she often couldn't even swallow over the lump in her throat. But nothing was worse than the feeling of emptiness that seemed to clutch at her chest and wouldn't let her breath.\nShe gasped, her tired, battered body shaking with every movement. She was exhausted. Thoughts raced through her head like a stampede, forcing her to keep her eyes open well into the late hours of the night. She wasn't sleeping.\nShe hadn't slept in a very long time, and she could feel her battered body about to give out. To fall. Not to get up again. She wasn't afraid of that. She wasn't afraid of the thought of not getting up any longer, of no longer feeling the sun's rays on her face, the human touch, the happiness. She wasn't afraid of the dark.\nThe darkness was deeply ingrained in her. It came to the surface more and more often, until one day it didn't go away. The darkness had closed a bubble around her from which she had no way to escape.\nA bubble she didn't want to let anyone else into. She couldn't help herself. She had no one to help her. Nor did anyone try. She accepted her bubble, her darkness, and stopped wanting to be rescued.\nShe began to ignore efforts to help her, and so the only one who could help her was her darkness. They talked at night, whispered during the day, and never left each other's side. She stopped seeing everything else, as if she perceived reality through a television screen.\nShe didn't find it real. She didn't even consider it anymore. She let her body succumb to the cold, the darkness, and ultimately the incredible emptiness. An emptiness that was all around her.\nIt had accompanied her all her life and appeared whenever she began to look forward to better times. \"Everyone's leaving you...\" It ran through her thoughts, but the phrase no longer set them off. She was resigned to it.\nShe knew she wasn't worthy of love. No one deserved to love such an unhappy, damaged soul. She was alone. In her bubble. Surrounded by emptiness.",
	"45741217001": "BOOM. The slamming of the door. Shuffling footsteps.\nMolly's muffled but angry tone floated through the Burrow.\nShe knew.\nShe already knew what was coming next.\nVery quickly she gave up the idea of a quiet evening. With a sigh, she put down the book she had been absently crumpling in her hands for the last two hours and moved to a smaller, chamois stool.\nShe and Ron had converted his room into a space for the two of them before the summer began. Back then, she'd naively thought she'd be joining him and Harry for Auror training.\nShe slid the small tea set Molly had left outside her door earlier. She never said anything, but she could feel the understanding in her gestures.\nThe door burst open and a clearly dazed Ron marched in. His eyes were glassy and his eyebrows were furrowed from concentration. She froze.\n\"You.\" He said, his eyes boring into her with an intensity that made her squint. \"Don't stare at me like that.\" He muttered and stumbled into the room with a loud slam of the door. \"I know what you want to say and save it for another time, Hermione. I don't need to listen to you today.\" He said in a disgusted tone and began to approach her.\nA smirk appeared on his face and he continued, gobbling, \"And to make sure you keep your mouth shut, I'm going to stuff it with something.\"\nHermione's stomach clenched. Who was this man in front of her? She searched his eyes, but saw nothing in them and quickly returned her gaze back to the floor. She opened her mouth to say something : \"Ron...\"\n\"Shut up!\" He squeaked and Hermione jumped in surprise, instinctively leaning back to be as far away from him as possible.\n\"I fucking said something! For once, be good at something and do what I tell you.\" He growled, and Hermione felt that last constant sensation of hot tears rolling down her tired eyes and falling into her arms. Ron, however, continued ruthlessly.\n\"You live in my room, in my house, under my rules, and you're going to fucking do whatever I tell you, or else...\"\n\"Not for long.\"\n\"What?\"\n\"I've decided to go back to 8th year.\" She said in a low voice, staring at a spot on the floor.\nSilence.\nThe silence that seemed endless was cut by his barking laughter.\n\"No, you're not coming back.\"\n\"That's not for you to decide.\" She finally looked him in the eye.\nAnger.\n\"You. Are. Not. Going. Anywhere.\" He clenched through his teeth, his chest heaving violently.\nHermione didn't know when or how it happened. He was at her side in two strides, both hands clasping her wrists. Abruptly, he yanked her down from the stool and her knees collided with the hard, wooden floor.\n\"Please, Ron...\"\nSwing. Her head flew back as his knuckles collided with her nose. Her body wanted to follow her face, but he still had one wrist in her hand, holding her in place.\nHer world stopped. Her eyes blurred and her blood rushed in her ears. Streams of blood poured from her nose, mixing with the blood from her mouth. It wasn't her first punch from Ron, but it was definitely one of the strongest.\nShe blinked and tried to focus in Ron's direction.\nRon didn't hesitate. In one motion, he pulled his trousers down and kicked them off his ankles. She felt him grab both of her wrists again, lift her by her limp arms, and throw her over the stool. Please don't. Her belly and hips bumped hard against the corners of the stool, and if she'd managed to make a sound, a groan would surely have escaped her lips. Blood rushed to her head.\nBy the time she recovered from the change in position, Ron was muttering, \"Muffliato,\" and dropped the wand at his feet.\n\"Please,\" she whispered. She knew what was about to happen.\n\"You don't have to beg.\" He chuckled roughly. He lifted her skirt in a swift motion and she heard the ripping of fabric.\nPlease don't.\nShe couldn't say it out loud. She knew what he was going to do.\nHarry. Where's Harry?\nRon grabbed her wrists again and placed them on her back, where he squeezed them hard until she felt an uncomfortable burning sensation in her shoulders and shoulder blades. He grabbed her wrists in one hand and pulled down his boxers with the other.\nPlease don't.\nWet tears fell from her eyes and a pool of blood and tears quickly formed under her head. How had it all gone down like this? Why did she feel like the war had only just begun when it was over?\n\"At least I don't see that patronizing face of yours...\" Ron mumbled, sliding her panties to the side with his free hand. His touch burned her. Without warning, he entered her and she bit her lip hard to keep from crying out. No one would have heard her anyway.\nHarry.\nIt was as if a million needles were stabbing into her body at once. With each of Ron's next thrusts, it got worse. She could hear him panting, feel his hand crushing her wrists against her back, and feel his sweat hitting her lower back.\n\"Fuck.\" He gasped and continued to thrust even harder. Hermione wanted nothing more than disappear. For her to vanish from under his hands. That she could go back to a place where she was happy. Home. To her parents who didn't know she had ever existed.\nThe pain she felt all over her body was nothing compared to what she felt in her heart.\nWhen had it gone so wrong? When the boy she loved became a abuser? Of course, the war had changed him. The war had changed everyone. But did it change everyone for the worse?\nShe was no longer present. Her body jerked forward violently with his every movement. The blood rushed in her head. She fixed her gaze on the puddle beneath her head.\nDrip. Drip.\nShe could feel the drops of blood dripping from her nose. She was aware of the tears that had stopped burning her eyes. Her head, however, was working at 100%.\nWhen will it stop? When will everything stop?! She wanted it to stop. She wanted life to end. Why is something like this happening? Hadn't she done enough through the war to deserve a better life? Was Ron really the only person in her life? WHERE'S HARRY? Why did he leave her here alone with him? Why did he have to take his side even in this situation? Why am I alone?\nShe heard Ron exhale sharply and felt him fill her with his fluids. She could feel it sticking to her thighs. Ron quickly pulled away from her. \"Fuck.\"\nShe heard the tugging of boxers and the sliding on of trousers. Zipper. A sharp intake of breath.\nSilence.\nShe knew he was watching her. Waiting. Waiting for her to break.\nShe didn't even move. She didn't realize when he let go of her wrists. Her hands lay limp, fallen in a pool of her blood and tears. Her eyes closed tightly.\nBOOM.\nAnother slamming of the door. He left.\nHermione exhaled deeply not realizing how much she was holding her breath. She slowly opened her eyes. All she could see was a puddle and her limp hands soaking in it.\nHer eyes darted to where the word MUDBLOOD was still engraved in blood.\nShe closed her eyes.\nIt felt like it had happened only yesterday. She saw Bellatrix's mad eyes as she leaned over her. She saw Draco Malfoy's eyes boring into her and the pure horror in them.\nSighing deeply, she tried to unclench her stiffened hands and braced herself on the stool so she could pull herself to her feet. Her whole body ached.\nThe first thing she saw when she opened her eyes again was a second pool of blood. She stared dumbly at the drops falling into the second pool, not realizing at first where they were dripping from. Her gaze followed one small, thick drop, and she was horrified to realize that the blood was flowing from between her legs. Her eyes welled up with tears again.\nNo.\nShe can't cry.\nNot now. He'll be back in a minute. She has to disappear.\nWith a wave of her wand, she let all the blood disappear. She stared for a moment at the empty spot on the floor where her despair had been materialized only moments ago. She shook her head and wiped away a few naughty tears that had leaked from her eyes though she tried to prevent it.\nShe stuffed the book she had wanted to read earlier under her arm and with a quick step that made her feel every wound on her body, she walked over to the bed where she pulled out her suitcase. She had things packed from the morning. She still had a week before she had to return to Hogwarts, but she knew she couldn't stay here a minute longer.\nShe tossed the book into the prepared trunk and closed it with a flick of her wand. She enlarged the other luggages she had placed next to the trunk. Pulling out a pair of jeans and a sweater, she quickly changed and made the things she'd been wearing moments ago, when Ron had done something he'd promised would never happen again, disappear.\nShe swung her small purse over her shoulder, to which she used an expansion charm like when she and Harry were looking for Horcruxes, and pulled out a classic muggle Ibalgin. She took two at once and swallowed them down empty. Even the Ibalgin couldn't beat that taste of blood in her mouth.\nShe returned the box to her bag and looked around the room. It was strange to leave this place. She'd spent three months here. After the war, she had nowhere to go back to, and since she'd been with Ron, he'd suggested she move in with them. She didn't hesitate. She loved Ron's family. His house. Our home. In the beginning, everything was so beautifully colorful and welcoming. So many vivid and happy memories. All the laughter, her own laughter, bounced off the walls and crept into her ears like mockery. This place was no longer her home. She no longer felt the warmth that had always been present here through all the years.\nWhen did that change? Was it when he first came home drunk? Or the first time he hit her? Was it when Harry heard and saw everything but decided to do nothing and leave without a word? Was it the first time he raped her?\nShe didn't know.\nAll she knew was that she had to leave. She still loved him, with all her heart. But she couldn't stay here. She took a deep breath and tried to think of where she was going to go.\nShe could go home. To an empty house where her parents weren't.\nNo.\nI need to talk to Harry.\nBut he doesn't want to talk to you.\nAs awful as it sounded, it was true. She knew Harry would come when he was ready. She knew him like the back of her hand. She knew everything that had happened during the war. What had happened at Hogwarts. And she also knew that there was a lot Harry hadn't told her. What he hadn't processed yet. She gave him time to process it in his own way. He never had time.\nBut she didn't have time.\nShe looked down at the big double bed with the blue duvet, where she had cried as many nights in the last three months as she hadn't cried in her entire life. Where she waited for him naively. Where they had made love. Where he'd hit her. She swallowed. Where he raped her...\nShe looked stubbornly out the window. Molly would understand. Ginny already understood. She tightened her lips and apparated herself with a deep breath.\n",
